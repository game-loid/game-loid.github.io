In this article, we will discuss the top picks for heroes that you should consider building as your first E5 hero, from each of the four factions: water, fire, wind, and earth. We will also analyze their abilities and strengths, with a focus on their performance in the reincarnation trial.\nBefore we dive into the details, it’s important to note that the reincarnation trial is a crucial aspect of the game. It allows players to generate a substantial amount of food, which is essential for hero growth. Therefore, choosing heroes that excel in the trial is crucial for maximizing progress.\nWater Faction We start with the water faction and one of the top picks, Lee Shishi. She is a powerful support hero with high healing abilities and additional buffs for her team. Although she may not excel as a solo carry in the reincarnation trial, she is an excellent addition to any team.\nNext is Lee, a damage-focused crowd controller hero. With a damage-over-time (DOT) ability and strong crowd control skills, Lee synergizes well with herself and can be a valuable asset. However, it’s important to note that the water faction as a whole is not ideal for the reincarnation trial, although they have other uses.\nMoving on to Kim Shi Huang, he is a super tanky hero, comparable to Corpse Demon from Idol Heroes. While he performs well in PvP and various game modes, the water faction lacks a standout hero for the reincarnation trial.\nFire Faction The fire faction offers numerous excellent picks, starting with the brand new hero, Lee Guang. As a new addition, his true potential in the reincarnation trial is yet to be determined, but he excels in dealing damage, especially against single targets.\nAnother noteworthy hero is Sun Xi Jiang, who functions as a support hero with strong healing abilities and a valuable two-round stun skill. While not an immediate choice for early game builds, she is undoubtedly a hero worth keeping in your roster.\nNee Zhang is a hero reminiscent of Karim from the abyss faction in Idol Heroes. He can attack multiple targets, steal attack from enemies, and convert a percentage of damage dealt into his own health. In the early game, he is an exceptional choice for the reincarnation trial.\nZu Liang is a hero that thrives in multiple quantities. With his ability to stack Trigram marks and deal increasing damage, multiple copies of him can create a formidable team. While he may not excel as a solo hero, he is a valuable asset in creating an army-like team.\nWind Faction In the wind faction, Lady of Yue stands out as a powerful hero with high attack damage and a bleeding effect. Her abilities and lengthy descriptions indicate her strength as an assassin-type hero, capable of dealing massive damage.\nHua Mulan is another top pick in the wind faction. With her focus on area-of-effect (AOE) damage and reliance on bleed effects, she can be a valuable asset, especially in PvP battles. She resembles Cathuga from the Idol Heroes universe and is expected to perform well in the reincarnation trial.\nDao Quao stands as a support hero and healer in the wind faction. With her healing prowess, she is an excellent hero to have on your team, bringing stability and support to your hero lineup.\nEarth Faction The earth faction offers a couple of viable heroes for the reincarnation trial. Linpow is a strong hero known for his performance in campaign and sky tower modes. Although not specifically designed for the trial, he is an all-around solid hero.\nSushu, on the other hand, excels in mark damage and performs remarkably well in multiples, similar to the aforementioned hero, Zu Liang. Having multiple copies of Sushu in your team will significantly contribute to your progress in the reincarnation trial.\nCow Cow, with his high damage output, chance to petrify targets, and bleed effects, is another solid hero choice. Although he may not excel in other parts of the game, he is a reliable option for the reincarnation trial.\nAs you embark on your journey in Ode to Heroes, it is important to prioritize heroes that perform well in the reincarnation trial. While some heroes shine in the trial, others may be better suited for different game modes. Careful consideration of their abilities, synergies, and strengths will guide you in selecting the heroes that align with your playstyle and goals.\nRemember to stay tuned for more guides and content related to Ode to Heroes.
