Do you want to know how to gear them up effectively? In this article, we will delve into the world of tanks in King’s Raid and provide you with all the information you need to become a master tank. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, this guide will help you make informed decisions when it comes to building tanks.\nBefore we dive into the details, it’s important to understand the role of a tank in King’s Raid. A tank’s primary job is to protect the team by soaking up damage and controlling the enemy’s aggression. They play a crucial role in ensuring the survival of the team and maximizing its damage output. Therefore, choosing the right tank and equipping them with the appropriate gear is essential for success in the game.\nChoosing the Right Tank The first step in building a tank is understanding the requirements of the content you will be facing. Different bosses and monsters have different mechanics and damage types. You need to consider whether you need a tank that can provide magic damage to support your magical team members, decrease the boss’s defense, increase your team’s survival chances, or simply stay alive against deadly bosses. There is no one-size-fits-all tank; you need to select the one that is best suited for your team and the content you are facing.\nGear and Stats Considerations Once you have chosen your tank, it’s crucial to gear them up properly. The gear you choose should be tailored to the specific content you will be facing. For example, if you are facing a boss that deals both physical and magical damage, you need to find a balance between physical and magical defense. Some bosses, however, only deal physical or magical damage, so you can focus on one defense type.\nHP and Defense When it comes to tanking, HP is the most important stat. The more HP your tank has, the more damage they can absorb. However, having too much HP without enough defenses can be detrimental. It’s essential to strike a balance between HP and defenses. Aim for at least 70k defense of the type you are tanking, but in a mixed set, you can have both physical and magical defense.\nBlock Block is another crucial stat for tanks. When your tank blocks an attack, they take significantly less damage. The recommended amount of block is around 1k. Note that there is a cap on block chance at 66%. Going above this cap will not increase your block chance further, so keep this in mind when choosing gear and stats for your tank.\nP Block Def and Unblock P Block Def and Unblock are stats that increase the amount of damage you block when you successfully block. They can be useful in reducing the damage you take. However, these stats are limited to certain gear and unique treasures, so you need to explore your options carefully.\nToughness Toughness, also known as resistance, is a stat that provides additional damage reduction after your defense stats are calculated. It can be especially useful when facing bosses that have penetration or ignore defense. Stacking toughness instead of defense can be a good strategy in these situations.\nDodge Dodge allows your tank to completely avoid damage when they successfully dodge an attack. Aim for at least 50% dodge on either type of damage or both if you are facing mixed damage. This can significantly increase your tank’s survival chances.\nPerks In addition to gear and stats, selecting the right perks for your tank is crucial. Tier 3 and 5 perks usually depend on the content you are facing and the specific tank you are using. Common perks include HP up, defense up, Monster Hunter (reduced damage taken), and Experienced Fighter. You can also choose perks that provide additional benefits such as increased block chance, attack speed, or a balance of HP, defense, and block.\nBuilding a Balanced Tank Building a balanced tank requires making choices and finding the right combination of gear, stats, and perks. Consider whether you need more HP, defense, block, toughness, or dodge based on the content you are facing. While there are other stats like lifesteal, attack speed, and mana recovery, their importance may vary depending on the tank and the situation.\nIn conclusion, when it comes to building tanks in King’s Raid, understanding the specific content you are facing is crucial. Choosing the right tank, gearing them up with the appropriate gear, and selecting the right stats and perks are essential for success. Remember to strike a balance between HP and defenses, aim for a good amount of block, consider using toughness against bosses with penetration, and prioritize dodge to avoid damage. With these tips in mind, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a master tank in King’s Raid!\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and build that unbeatable tank for your team in King’s Raid!\n","wordCount":"837","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michelle Statum"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/kings-raid-p.-block/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>King's Raid - How to Build Tanks: A Comprehensive Guide to Tanking in King's Raid</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 23, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;837 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michelle Statum</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#choosing-the-right-tank>Choosing the Right Tank</a></li><li><a href=#gear-and-stats-considerations>Gear and Stats Considerations</a><ul><li><a href=#hp-and-defense>HP and Defense</a></li><li><a href=#block>Block</a></li><li><a href=#p-block-def-and-unblock>P Block Def and Unblock</a></li><li><a href=#toughness>Toughness</a></li><li><a href=#dodge>Dodge</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#perks>Perks</a></li><li><a href=#building-a-balanced-tank>Building a Balanced Tank</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIq5s2USaNA style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Are you struggling with choosing the right tank for your team in King&rsquo;s Raid?
