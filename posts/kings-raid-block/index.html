Tanks are crucial in providing protection to the team, mitigating damage, and ensuring the survival of the team in battles against bosses and monsters. However, choosing the right tank and gearing them properly can be a daunting task. In this guide, we will explore everything you need to know about tanks, from picking the right tank to optimizing their gear for maximum effectiveness.\nUnderstanding the Role of Tanks The first step in building a tank is understanding the specific needs of your team and the content you will be facing. Different bosses and monsters have different abilities and attack patterns, and your tank should be able to counter those effectively. For example, if you are facing a boss that deals magical damage, you will want a tank with high magic defense. On the other hand, if the boss has high physical damage, a tank with high physical defense is essential. Consider your team’s composition and the specific needs of the content to determine the type of tank you need.\nOptimizing Stats for Tanks Now that you have a general understanding of the role of tanks, let’s delve into the key stats that you should focus on when gearing your tank. The primary stat that you should prioritize is HP. The more HP your tank has, the more damage they can absorb. However, it is important to strike a balance between HP and defenses. Having too much health without enough defense can leave your tank vulnerable. Aim for around 70k defense for a single type of damage or a mixed set if needed.\nUnderstanding Defense Stats: Physical Defense and Magic Defense Besides HP, defense stats are crucial for the survivability of your tank. The two main defense stats to focus on are physical defense and magic defense. Physical defense is effective against melee attacks and physical damage, while magic defense is effective against magical attacks. It is crucial to have a good balance between these two defense stats to mitigate damage effectively. Aim for around 70-90% defense to optimize your tank’s survivability.\nThe Importance of Block Another crucial stat for tanks is block. When your tank blocks an attack, they take reduced damage. Aim for around 1k block for optimal damage reduction. However, it is important to note that after reaching a certain point (around 66% block chance), the effectiveness of block decreases. So while having high block chance is good, going beyond the soft cap won’t provide significant benefits.\nUnderstanding P-Block Def and P-Block Def Reduction P-Block Def and P-Block Def Reduction are stats that increase the amount of damage your tank blocks when they successfully block an attack. These stats are crucial for further damage reduction when your tank blocks. Aim to increase these stats to maximize your tank’s damage mitigation. These stats are mainly obtainable through unique treasures and enchantments.\nToughness: The Unseen Damage Reduction Toughness, also known as resistance, is a stat that provides additional damage reduction after the defense stats have been calculated. This additional layer of damage reduction is particularly useful against bosses with high penetration or those that ignore defense. Consider adding points to this stat if you are facing such bosses. Physical toughness and magical toughness can be obtained through runes or certain treasures.\nThe Benefits of Dodge Dodge is a stat that allows your tank to dodge incoming attacks completely. Aim for around 50% dodge chance to minimize damage taken. This stat is particularly useful against bosses with mixed damage types or when facing a versatile boss that deals both physical and magical damage.\nAdditional Considerations and Perks In addition to the aforementioned stats, there are other factors to consider when building a tank. Lifesteal, attack speed, and mana recovery are all important for specific situations, so adjust your tank’s gear and perks accordingly. For perks, prioritize HP up, defense up, and Monster Hunter for increased survivability. Other perks, such as Battle Cry, increased block chance, and attack speed, can be chosen based on the specific needs of your team and the content you are facing.\nOptimizing Gear for Different Bosses Depending on the boss or content you are facing, you may need to adjust your tank’s gear. For example, if you are facing a boss with high physical damage, focus on increasing your physical defense and block chance. If the boss deals both physical and magical damage, aim for a balance between the two. Remember to consider the specific needs of your team and the content when choosing and optimizing your tank’s gear.\nConclusion Building a tank in King’s Raid requires careful consideration of various factors, such as the needs of your team, the content you are facing, and the specific stats required for effective tanking. By focusing on key stats like HP, defense, block, toughness, and dodge, and adjusting your gear based on the boss or content, you can optimize your tank’s effectiveness and ensure the survival of your team. Experiment with different builds and perks to find the best combination that suits your playstyle and the specific challenges you encounter in the world of King’s Raid.\n","wordCount":"865","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Betty Adair"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/kings-raid-block/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>King's Raid - How to Build Tanks: A Comprehensive Guide to Tanking Strategies and Gear</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;865 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Betty Adair</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIq5s2USaNA style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>In the world of King&rsquo;s Raid, one of the most important roles in any team is the tank.
