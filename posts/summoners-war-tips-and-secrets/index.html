In this guide, we will provide you with 20 essential tips to help new players navigate the game and progress efficiently. From completing the Summoner’s Way questline to building an effective team, we’ll cover it all. So, let’s dive in and discover the key strategies and secrets to success in Summoners War.\nTip 1: Start the Summoner’s Way Questline The first and most important tip is to start the Summoner’s Way questline and complete it. By doing so, you not only receive a Transcendence scroll that guarantees a Nat 5 monster but also gain a path for progression and acquire valuable monsters along the way. This questline introduces you to key characters such as Fran, the light fairy queen, Lapis, Seth, Spectra, and Shannon, all of whom will play critical roles in your journey. Prioritize building Fran and Seth, as they have great versatility and can be used in various game modes, especially Giants.\nTip 2: Save Every Monster from the Summoner’s Way Questline As you progress through the Summoner’s Way questline, you will encounter monsters like Fran, Lapis, Seth, Spectra, and Shannon. It is essential to save each of these monsters, as they serve specific purposes. Many of them are vital for Giants B12, Trial of Ascension, or DB12. Fran, in particular, is a versatile healer and can be used in the starter team as well as a substitute leader for the DoT team. Prioritize building Fran and Seth to maximize your team’s potential.\nTip 3: Second Awaken Fran and Seth To further enhance Fran and Seth’s abilities, consider second awakening them. Second awakening is a process that strengthens a monster’s stats, skills, and overall effectiveness. Fran, in particular, plays a crucial role in the infamous DoT team, known for its efficiency in clearing Giants B12. By second awakening Fran, you unlock her full potential as a healer, support, and leader. Likewise, second awakening Seth improves his damage output and makes him an excellent addition to the DoT team.\nTip 4: Clear Tartarus in Hard Mode During the Summoner’s Way questline, you will encounter a segment that requires you to clear a stage of Tartarus in hard mode. However, you can complete a time-limited floor to fulfill this requirement, as long as you clear above wave 10. This tip allows you to progress in the questline efficiently and unlock further rewards.\nTip 5: Farm Artifacts in Artifacts Dungeons Regardless of the floor you can currently complete in either the Steel Fortress or Punisher’s Crypt, make it a priority to farm artifacts. Artifacts provide stat bonuses to your monsters, such as HP, defense, or attack. The rarity of the artifact determines the number of sub-stats it has, rather than the overall stat bonus. Equipping your six-star monsters with artifacts significantly improves their survivability and damage output. You can always sell previous artifacts once you obtain better ones.\nTip 6: Utilize the Dot Team in Artifact Dungeons If you have already built the Dot team, it can be highly effective in clearing artifact dungeons as well. The Dot team consists of monsters like Fran, Vermos, and Seth, who excel in dealing damage over time. By utilizing their abilities, you can clear artifact dungeons efficiently and earn valuable rewards.\nTip 7: Prioritize Stats Over Sets for Runes When it comes to equipping your monsters with runes, prioritize stats over sets. Avoid sacrificing essential stats like HP, defense, or crit rate just to complete a specific set. This tip is especially crucial for PvE content. While completing a full set of Swift or Fatal runes can be beneficial, it is not worth sacrificing critical stats. Focus on individual rune stats that improve your monster’s performance and overall progression.\nTip 8: Choose the Right Monsters to Second Awaken When deciding which monsters to second awaken, consider the specific goals or teams you are aiming for. For example, if you plan on rushing down the DoT team for Giants B10 and B12, prioritize second awakening Seth and Tatu. Additionally, you can obtain Crow, the dark inugami, who offers great value in the starter teams and remains valuable throughout the game. Choose monsters that complement your desired team composition and enhance your overall gameplay experience.\nTip 9: Focus on Giant’s Keep Level 10 (GB10) and Level 12 (GB12) One of the essential milestones for new players is reaching GB10 and GB12. These dungeons yield valuable rewards such as Swift runes, Despair runes, Fatal runes, and more. Swift runes, in particular, significantly increase the overall speed of your monsters. Speed is a crucial stat that influences turn order and provides a competitive advantage in battles. Make it a primary goal to clear GB10 and GB12 on auto mode to unlock these rewards and improve your team’s overall strength.\nTip 10: Aim for Full Speed Sets to Increase Monster Speed To maximize your monster’s speed, aim for a full set of Swift runes. Unlike other stats, speed does not appear as a percentage on a single rune. Equipping your monster with a full set of Swift runes is the only way to achieve a percentage increase in speed. Prioritizing speed improves your turn order, grants more turns, and enhances overall gameplay efficiency. Therefore, focus on acquiring and equipping Swift runes whenever possible.\nTip 11: Build a Team for Giants B10 and B12 (DoT Team) If your goal is to conquer Giants B10 and B12, consider building a DoT team. The DoT team consists of essential monsters like Fran, Vermos, Seth, and Tatu. Fran or Vermos can serve as your leader for a safer approach. Additionally, include the wind dryad Melea and the second-awakened Sath and Tatu in your team. These monsters synergize well and provide excellent damage over time effects, making Giants B10 and B12 easier to clear.\nTip 12: Consider the Starter Team for Giants B12 Alternatively, if you prefer a simpler approach to Giants B12, you can use the starter team. This team composition typically includes Vermos or Sigmarus as the leader, followed by Fran, Lauren, and two other damage dealers like Crow or Naomi. This team composition allows for a well-rounded approach to Giants B12, focusing on overall survivability and damage output.\nTip 13: Progress to Trial of Ascension (TOA) Normal After successfully clearing GB12, it’s time to progress to Trial of Ascension (TOA) Normal. TOA offers great rewards and serves as a significant milestone in your Summoners War journey. Aim to complete as many floors of TOA Normal as possible, with the ultimate goal of reaching floor 100. TOA rewards include crystals, summons, and devilmon, valuable resources for powering up your monsters. Remember, do not use devilmon on monsters that are not Nat 5s. Save them for your most powerful and rare monsters.\nTip 14: Save Your Resources and Avoid Over-Leveling Monsters To optimize your resource management, it is crucial to save your resources whenever possible. Avoid six-starring or even five-starring every monster you acquire without a purpose. It is perfectly acceptable to store monsters in your storage until you are ready to use them. Focus on building and powering up the most valuable monsters for your desired teams and progression goals. This way, you can efficiently allocate your resources and avoid wasting them on unnecessary upgrades.\nTip 15: Set a Farming Defense in Arena In the Arena, it is recommended to set a farming defense. A farming defense is a low-level and weak defense that is easy for other players to defeat. By setting a farming defense, you will be matched against similarly low-ranked players, making it easier to farm Glory points through completed Arena Wings. Utilize this strategy to focus on leveling up your Arena Towers, which provide passive bonuses and enhance your overall gameplay experience.\nTip 16: Join a Guild and Take Advantage of Guild Bonuses Joining a guild has numerous benefits for new players. Guild bonuses are similar to Arena Towers but apply to PvE content. As you progress in your guild, you will unlock various bonuses that improve your overall gameplay efficiency. Additionally, being part of a guild grants access to the Guild Shop, where you can acquire valuable rewards like the weekly 5-star Rainbowmon, which expedites the six-starring process. Take advantage of guild-related features to accelerate your progression in Summoners War.\nTip 17: Explore Fusion in the Fusion Hexagram Fusions in Summoners War open up new possibilities and strengthen your monster lineup. The Fusion Hexagram is where you can perform various fusions to obtain powerful monsters. Melia is a recommended fusion monster, especially if you are focused on the DoT team. Additionally, monsters like Veromos, Sigmarus, and Baleygr are excellent fusion options that can significantly enhance your team’s capabilities in various game modes.\nTip 18: Prioritize Building Monsters for Different Game Modes As you progress in Summoners War, it is crucial to prioritize building monsters that excel in specific game modes. For example, Jean is a great addition to your team for Trial of Ascension, while Zhang Fei shines as a frontliner in Raid level 5 (R5). Explore different options based on your goals and desired team compositions. Remember to research and experiment to find the best monsters for each game mode.\nTip 19: Focus on Dungeon Progression Dungeon progression is a vital aspect of Summoners War. Building a team capable of clearing dungeons like Dragon’s Lair and BJ5 (Baleygr 5) is essential. Focus on building monsters like Verdehile, who is widely used as a leader in Dragon’s B10 and B12 due to his exceptional speed lead and attack bar boost. Additionally, consider adding a stripper, a monster capable of removing buffs from the enemy, to improve your success rate in Dragon dungeons.\nTip 20: Learn from Others and Share Experiences Lastly, embrace the Summoners War community and the wealth of knowledge available. Watch tutorial videos, join forums, and engage with experienced players. Learning from others can significantly enhance your understanding of the game and help you overcome challenges more efficiently. Share your experiences and strategies with fellow players, as collaboration and community interaction can foster growth and improvement in Summoners War.\nConclusion In conclusion, these 20 essential tips for new players will help you navigate and thrive in Summoners War. From prioritizing the Summoner’s Way questline and building key monsters to focusing on dungeon progression and joining a guild, these strategies provide a solid foundation for success. Remember to save your resources, experiment with different teams, and learn from the community to continuously improve your gameplay. With these tips in mind, embark on your Summoners War journey and conquer the challenges that await you.\n","wordCount":"1775","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christopher

Therefore, focus on acquiring and equipping Swift runes whenever possible.</p><h2 id=tip-11-build-a-team-for-giants-b10-and-b12-dot-team>Tip 11: Build a Team for Giants B10 and B12 (DoT Team)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-11-build-a-team-for-giants-b10-and-b12-dot-team>#</a></h2><p>If your goal is to conquer Giants B10 and B12, consider building a DoT team. The DoT team consists of essential monsters like Fran, Vermos, Seth, and Tatu. Fran or Vermos can serve as your leader for a safer approach. Additionally, include the wind dryad Melea and the second-awakened Sath and Tatu in your team. These monsters synergize well and provide excellent damage over time effects, making Giants B10 and B12 easier to clear.</p><h2 id=tip-12-consider-the-starter-team-for-giants-b12>Tip 12: Consider the Starter Team for Giants B12<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-12-consider-the-starter-team-for-giants-b12>#</a></h2><p>Alternatively, if you prefer a simpler approach to Giants B12, you can use the starter team. This team composition typically includes Vermos or Sigmarus as the leader, followed by Fran, Lauren, and two other damage dealers like Crow or Naomi. This team composition allows for a well-rounded approach to Giants B12, focusing on overall survivability and damage output.</p><h2 id=tip-13-progress-to-trial-of-ascension-toa-normal>Tip 13: Progress to Trial of Ascension (TOA) Normal<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-13-progress-to-trial-of-ascension-toa-normal>#</a></h2><p>After successfully clearing GB12, it&rsquo;s time to progress to Trial of Ascension (TOA) Normal. TOA offers great rewards and serves as a significant milestone in your Summoners War journey. Aim to complete as many floors of TOA Normal as possible, with the ultimate goal of reaching floor 100. TOA rewards include crystals, summons, and devilmon, valuable resources for powering up your monsters. Remember, do not use devilmon on monsters that are not Nat 5s. Save them for your most powerful and rare monsters.</p><h2 id=tip-14-save-your-resources-and-avoid-over-leveling-monsters>Tip 14: Save Your Resources and Avoid Over-Leveling Monsters<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-14-save-your-resources-and-avoid-over-leveling-monsters>#</a></h2><p>To optimize your resource management, it is crucial to save your resources whenever possible. Avoid six-starring or even five-starring every monster you acquire without a purpose. It is perfectly acceptable to store monsters in your storage until you are ready to use them. Focus on building and powering up the most valuable monsters for your desired teams and progression goals. This way, you can efficiently allocate your resources and avoid wasting them on unnecessary upgrades.</p><h2 id=tip-15-set-a-farming-defense-in-arena>Tip 15: Set a Farming Defense in Arena<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-15-set-a-farming-defense-in-arena>#</a></h2><p>In the Arena, it is recommended to set a farming defense. A farming defense is a low-level and weak defense that is easy for other players to defeat. By setting a farming defense, you will be matched against similarly low-ranked players, making it easier to farm Glory points through completed Arena Wings. Utilize this strategy to focus on leveling up your Arena Towers, which provide passive bonuses and enhance your overall gameplay experience.</p><h2 id=tip-16-join-a-guild-and-take-advantage-of-guild-bonuses>Tip 16: Join a Guild and Take Advantage of Guild Bonuses<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-16-join-a-guild-and-take-advantage-of-guild-bonuses>#</a></h2><p>Joining a guild has numerous benefits for new players. Guild bonuses are similar to Arena Towers but apply to PvE content. As you progress in your guild, you will unlock various bonuses that improve your overall gameplay efficiency. Additionally, being part of a guild grants access to the Guild Shop, where you can acquire valuable rewards like the weekly 5-star Rainbowmon, which expedites the six-starring process. Take advantage of guild-related features to accelerate your progression in Summoners War.</p><h2 id=tip-17-explore-fusion-in-the-fusion-hexagram>Tip 17: Explore Fusion in the Fusion Hexagram<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-17-explore-fusion-in-the-fusion-hexagram>#</a></h2><p>Fusions in Summoners War open up new possibilities and strengthen your monster lineup. The Fusion Hexagram is where you can perform various fusions to obtain powerful monsters. Melia is a recommended fusion monster, especially if you are focused on the DoT team. Additionally, monsters like Veromos, Sigmarus, and Baleygr are excellent fusion options that can significantly enhance your team&rsquo;s capabilities in various game modes.</p><h2 id=tip-18-prioritize-building-monsters-for-different-game-modes>Tip 18: Prioritize Building Monsters for Different Game Modes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-18-prioritize-building-monsters-for-different-game-modes>#</a></h2><p>As you progress in Summoners War, it is crucial to prioritize building monsters that excel in specific game modes. For example, Jean is a great addition to your team for Trial of Ascension, while Zhang Fei shines as a frontliner in Raid level 5 (R5). Explore different options based on your goals and desired team compositions. Remember to research and experiment to find the best monsters for each game mode.</p><h2 id=tip-19-focus-on-dungeon-progression>Tip 19: Focus on Dungeon Progression<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-19-focus-on-dungeon-progression>#</a></h2><p>Dungeon progression is a vital aspect of Summoners War. Building a team capable of clearing dungeons like Dragon&rsquo;s Lair and BJ5 (Baleygr 5) is essential. Focus on building monsters like Verdehile, who is widely used as a leader in Dragon&rsquo;s B10 and B12 due to his exceptional speed lead and attack bar boost. Additionally, consider adding a stripper, a monster capable of removing buffs from the enemy, to improve your success rate in Dragon dungeons.</p><h2 id=tip-20-learn-from-others-and-share-experiences>Tip 20: Learn from Others and Share Experiences<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tip-20-learn-from-others-and-share-experiences>#</a></h2><p>Lastly, embrace the Summoners War community and the wealth of knowledge available. Watch tutorial videos, join forums, and engage with experienced players. Learning from others can significantly enhance your understanding of the game and help you overcome challenges more efficiently. Share your experiences and strategies with fellow players, as collaboration and community interaction can foster growth and improvement in Summoners War.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>In conclusion, these 20 essential tips for new players will help you navigate and thrive in Summoners War. From prioritizing the Summoner&rsquo;s Way questline and building key monsters to focusing on dungeon progression and joining a guild, these strategies provide a solid foundation for success. Remember to save your resources, experiment with different teams, and learn from the community to continuously improve your gameplay. With these tips in mind, embark on your Summoners War journey and conquer the challenges that await you.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/orbis-locations-epic-seven/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Epic Seven: How to Obtain and Utilize Breath of Orbis Effectively</span></a>
