These valuable items can be sold to the in-game merchant for a whopping 10,000 gold each. However, with the Rhinoceros Beetle charm equipped, players can sell each beetle for a staggering 20,000 gold, leading to a potential total of 60,000 gold. Additionally, consuming each beetle grants a permanent boost to the player’s health, similar to consuming a yellow herb. This comprehensive guide will provide you with the locations of all the Rhinoceros Beetles in the game, allowing you to accumulate significant wealth and enhance your gameplay experience.\nFinding the Rhinoceros Beetles The first Rhinoceros Beetle can be found at the beginning of the game, in the village where you encounter hostile villagers. Look for a tree near a small shack on the path leading to the village. The beetle will be visibly perched on top of the tree, making it relatively easy to spot.\nThe second beetle can be obtained after defeating Del Lago, a massive lake-dwelling creature. Once you have defeated Del Lago, search the area near the lake for a small building. Inside this building, you will find the second Rhinoceros Beetle.\nProgress further in the game until you reach the castle. Inside the castle, make your way to the hedge maze area. Look for a statue holding a lantern. Interact with the statue to make it drop a key. Use this key to open a door leading to a room containing the third Rhinoceros Beetle.\nAfter obtaining the third beetle, head to the garden area of the castle. In this area, you will find a greenhouse. Enter the greenhouse and search the plants to discover the fourth Rhinoceros Beetle.\nThe fifth Rhinoceros Beetle can be found in the storage room of the castle. As you explore the castle, keep an eye out for a room with wine barrels. Inside this room, the beetle will be waiting for you.\nContinue playing until you reach the island section of the game. In the island’s military base, look for a room with a large cage. Inside this room, you will find the sixth Rhinoceros Beetle.\nThe seventh beetle is located in the military facility on the island. As you explore the facility, you will come across a room with cages. Search one of the cages to discover the seventh Rhinoceros Beetle.\nThe final Rhinoceros Beetle can be obtained during the boss fight with Saddler. Look for a rock structure in the boss arena. Interact with the structure to reveal an elevated platform. Climb onto the platform and collect the last beetle.\nSelling the Rhinoceros Beetles Once you have collected all the Rhinoceros Beetles, it’s time to cash in on your valuable treasures. Visit the merchant in the game and sell each beetle individually for 10,000 gold. However, if you have the Rhinoceros Beetle charm equipped, you can double your earnings and sell each beetle for a staggering 20,000 gold. This means that by selling all of the beetles, you could potentially accumulate a total of 60,000 gold. This substantial amount of wealth can be used to purchase powerful weapons and upgrades, enhancing your gameplay experience.\nConclusion In conclusion, the Rhinoceros Beetles in Resident Evil 4 are rare treasures that can significantly boost your in-game wealth. By following this guide and collecting all the beetles, you can potentially earn a total of 60,000 gold, providing you with the means to acquire powerful weapons and upgrades. Additionally, consuming each beetle grants a permanent boost to your health, further enhancing your gameplay experience. So, embark on this treasure-hunting adventure, locate all the Rhinoceros Beetles, and make the most of your Resident Evil 4 gameplay.
