Our step-by-step instructions will cover all the quests and rewards that you need to know about, so you can level up your character and obtain powerful gear. Get ready to embark on an epic adventure in the world of Blade and Soul.\nOverview of Soulboost Soulboost is a unique system in Blade and Soul that allows players to enhance their characters and acquire powerful gear. Season 3 of Soulboost introduces new quests, rewards, and challenges for players to tackle. By completing quests and collecting points, players can level up their character and unlock higher stages, which offer even better rewards.\nHow to Use Rewards Many new players struggle with understanding how to use the rewards obtained through Soulboost. In this guide, we will show you exactly how to use these rewards to enhance your character and improve your gameplay.\nTo start, navigate to the Soulboost tab in your inventory. Here, you will find a list of rewards that you can claim. By equipping these items, you will significantly boost your character’s power and effectiveness.\nEquip Soul Shields: Start by equipping the Soul Shields you receive. These powerful items will increase your defense and provide additional bonuses to your character. Equip Gems: Next, equip the gems that you obtained. These gems will enhance your character’s stats, such as attack power and critical damage. Open Chests: Open the chests you received from completing quests. These chests contain additional gear and items that will further improve your character’s performance. Enhance Pet: Use up the pet gems and pet stones to enhance your pet’s abilities. Increased pet power will provide valuable buffs and support in combat. Use Skill Books: Skill books are essential for improving your character’s skills. Accept the skill books and allocate skill points to enhance your abilities and increase your damage output. Completing Quests and Collecting Points To progress in Soulboost, you will need to complete quests and collect points. Each completed quest rewards you with points, which contribute to your overall level in Soulboost. As you level up, the quests will become more challenging but offer better rewards.\nDaily Login: Start by logging in five times for the week to earn rewards. This is the first stage of the Soulboost quests and serves as a simple introduction to the system. Complete Quests: To earn more points, you must complete a certain number of quests. Each completed quest increases your overall progress in Soulboost. Unlock Higher Stages: As you accumulate more points, you will unlock higher stages in Soulboost. These higher stages offer better rewards and gear upgrades. Time Efficiency: The Soulboost system is designed to be time-efficient. By completing certain dungeons and quests, you can quickly progress and collect rewards without spending excessive amounts of time. Augmenting Accessories and Weapons Once you have obtained your rewards and gear from Soulboost, you can further enhance your character by augmenting your accessories and weapons.\nExalt Psyches: Use the Exalt Psyches on your accessories to increase their stats and power. This will significantly boost your character’s overall effectiveness in combat. Augment Talisman and Badges: Augment your Talismans and Badges with the Storm Psyche to unlock additional stats and bonuses. This will provide you with a competitive edge in battles. Soul Augmentation: Use different evolution stones to evolve your Soul, Heart, and Talisman for additional stat boosts. These stones can be obtained from the Soulboost rewards. Enhance Weapon: If you want to further enhance your weapon, use the augmentation tab. However, keep in mind that using the augmentation tab will prevent you from using the succession tab. Additional Tips and Advice Recruitment: When recruiting for dungeons or quests, make sure to advertise in the faction chat or world chat. This will help you find teammates quickly and efficiently, especially if your character’s gear is stronger. Unity Rank: Level up your Unity rank by using Reputation Charms. This will give you additional stats and benefits, helping you become a formidable force in the game. Experiment with Different Accessories: Take the time to explore and experiment with different accessories, such as the Insignia chest. This will allow you to find the best combination of gear for your character and playstyle. In conclusion, mastering the Soulboost system in Blade and Soul is crucial for new and returning players. By following this step-by-step guide, you will be able to efficiently complete your quests, collect rewards, and enhance your character’s power. Gear up, recruit teammates, and embark on an epic journey in the world of Blade and Soul.\n","wordCount":"778","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Valerie Cameron"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/blade-and-soul-leveling/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>[Blade and Soul] Soulboost Season 3: Step by Step Guide For New & Returning Players</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 6, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;778 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Valerie Cameron</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#overview-of-soulboost>Overview of Soulboost</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-use-rewards>How to Use Rewards</a></li><li><a href=#completing-quests-and-collecting-points>Completing Quests and Collecting Points</a></li><li><a href=#augmenting-accessories-and-weapons>Augmenting Accessories and Weapons</a></li><li><a href=#additional-tips-and-advice>Additional Tips and Advice</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynoz7UHSK0Q style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Are you a new or returning player of Blade and Soul?
