Lyn is a four-star monster that is often considered a top-tier unit for both PvE and PvP content. We will explore the pros and cons of using either a Soul Link build or a Non-Soul Link build for Lyn and evaluate which build is better in terms of damage output and overall effectiveness.\nTower of Ascension and Spire Buffs Before diving into the comparison of Lyn’s builds, it’s important to note that maximizing your power level in Summoners War requires leveling up your Tower of Ascension and Spire Buffs. These buffs provide raw stats, such as increased attack, defense, and HP for both your Summoner and monsters. To level up these buffs, you need to complete challenges on each floor of the Celestial Spires and acquire different types of coins. This power increase can greatly enhance the capabilities of your monsters and your overall team performance.\nLyn’s Skills and Build Considerations Lyn’s skills make her a versatile damage dealer with potential to deal significant damage to bosses. Her basic attack not only deals 30% additional damage but also scales with the target’s Max HP. This means that Lyn benefits greatly from high attack stats and attack speed.\nWhen comparing the two builds for Lyn, it is important to understand the concept of Soul Link. Soul Link is a mechanic in Summoners War where certain monsters, such as Konamiya and Shannon, provide additional buffs and support to specific monsters on the team. In the case of Lyn, Soul Link can enhance her damage output and overall performance.\nNow, let’s proceed to the comparison of the two builds for Lyn.\nBuild 1: Non-Soul Link Attack Speed Build In this build, we focus on maximizing Lyn’s attack speed, which allows her to deal more damage quickly. The runes used for this build are on a swift Blade Set, with 91.7% critical rate, 128% critical damage, and 191 attack speed. The attack stat is 2866.\nTo test this build, we will use Lyn with Wendy and Megan, who provide attack buffs and attack speed buffs respectively. We will compare the DPS (damage per second) output of Lyn in this build by using her second skill and monitoring the damage numbers.\nInitially, the DPS reaches around 18,000 when Wendy’s buff is active, but it fluctuates based on the damage received and other factors. Overall, this build proves to be effective in terms of damage output, especially when paired with Megan’s attack speed buff.\nBuild 2: Soul Link Crit Damage Build In this build, we prioritize maximizing Lyn’s crit damage, as it amplifies her damage potential. The runes used for this build include an increase in crit damage and maintaining a balance between attack speed and crit damage. The stats for this build are 172 attack speed, 192 crit damage, and 361 attack.\nTo test this build, we once again use Lyn with Wendy and Megan, focusing on using Wendy’s crit damage buff and track the DPS using Lyn’s second skill. In this build, the DPS reaches around 17,000-18,000, indicating that crit damage does have a significant impact on Lyn’s damage output. However, compared to the Non-Soul Link build, this build falls slightly short.\nComparison and Conclusion Taking all factors into consideration, including the team composition and mechanics of the raid, both Lyn and Bulldozer prove to be great damage dealers in Summoners War. However, when comparing Lyn’s Soul Link and Non-Soul Link builds, it becomes clear that Lyn excels as a non-soul link damage dealer.\nLyn’s basic attack and damage scaling make her particularly effective in this role. While she does benefit from attack speed, the crit damage build, along with a balance between attack speed and crit damage, seems to be the most favorable for maximizing her damage potential.\nIn conclusion, Lyn’s overall damage output and effectiveness are higher when built as a non-soul link monster with a focus on attack, high crit damage, and a balanced attack speed. Players should consider this build when utilizing Lyn in their teams, especially in PvE scenarios such as dungeons and raids.\nRemember, it’s always essential to experiment and find the build that best suits your playstyle and team composition. With the right build and strategy, Lyn can become a formidable force on the battlefield in Summoners War.\nMake sure to subscribe to the Summoners War Chronicles channel for more insights and tips on optimizing your gameplay.\n","wordCount":"756","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Harry Boyd"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/light-amazon-summoners-war/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Which Build is Better for Lyn in Summoners War?
