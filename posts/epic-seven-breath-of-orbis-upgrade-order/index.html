In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know about utilizing this vital resource and optimizing your upgrades in the game. From the Heart of Orbis to the Steel Workshop, we will discuss the order in which you should prioritize your upgrades and how they will benefit you as a player. So let’s dive in and explore the breath of orbis upgrade order in detail.\n1. The Importance of Breath of Orbis Breath of Orbis is a valuable resource that can be obtained by completing adventure stages with a chaos gate. It is represented by a prism-like symbol next to the stage. These orbs are crucial for upgrading various buildings in the Sanctuary, each providing specific effects and benefits to the player. Therefore, it is essential to farm and accumulate as many Breath of Orbis as possible to enhance your gameplay experience.\n2. Upgrading the Heart of Orbis The Heart of Orbis is the central building in the Sanctuary and is responsible for generating gold and Skystones. Upgrading this building should be your top priority as a player, regardless of your stage in the game. By increasing its level, you will be able to store more gold and Skystones, which are essential for various activities such as summoning heroes and refreshing the secret shop.\nAdditionally, upgrading the Heart of Orbis will increase your chances of receiving double rewards, which can greatly enhance your Skystone and gold income. This is especially beneficial for newer players who may be lacking in heroes and need additional resources to progress in the game.\n3. High Command and Conquest Points Next, you should focus on upgrading your High Command, specifically the Barracks, to gain access to war missions. By completing these missions, you can earn conquest points, which are valuable for purchasing essential items such as MolaGora, energy, and arena gear. Conquest points are limited per day, so it is advisable to invest in upgrading the Barracks early on to maximize your daily conquest points.\n4. Steel Workshop and Gear Crafting Once you have upgraded the Heart of Orbis and the Barracks, it’s time to shift your focus to the Steel Workshop. Upgrading the Steel Workshop is crucial before you start crafting gear, as it will reduce the gold and reforge cost associated with crafting. The Artisan’s Furnace and the Blacksmith Dormitory should be your primary targets for improvement in the Steel Workshop.\nThe Artisan’s Furnace increases the chances of obtaining higher-quality gear, such as heroic and epic items, which are more valuable than rare gear. The Blacksmith Dormitory, on the other hand, reduces the resources required for crafting gear, making it more energy-efficient.\n5. Alchemist Steeple and Gear Enhancement Once you have maximized the effectiveness of the Steel Workshop, it’s time to upgrade the Alchemist Steeple. This building is particularly important for late-game players, as it unlocks various enhancements and options for modifying gear.\nThe Laboratory in the Alchemist Steeple allows you to access a range of improvements, such as modification jam conversions and equipment conversions. These features are essential for late-game players who want to optimize their gear and customize their main stats. Upgrading the Ingredient Storage in the Alchemist Steeple will reduce the resources required for crafting gear, making it a highly beneficial upgrade.\n6. Forest of Souls - Optional Upgrades Finally, we have the Forest of Souls, which houses the Phantasma and Penguin habitats. While some players recommend unlocking and upgrading the Forest of Souls early on, it is not a necessary step, particularly for newcomers. As a new player, you will receive ample Phantasma and Penguins through various in-game rewards, making the Forest of Souls upgrade less essential.\nConclusion In conclusion, the breath of orbis upgrade order in Epic Seven plays a crucial role in optimizing your gameplay and progress. By prioritizing upgrades to the Heart of Orbis, High Command, Steel Workshop, and Alchemist Steeple, you can enhance your resource generation, gear crafting capabilities, and gear enhancement options.\nRemember to farm Breath of Orbis through adventure stages with chaos gates, and make sure to clear the chaos gate and defeat the boss for maximum rewards. With a strategic approach to upgrading your Sanctuary, you can ensure a smooth and successful journey in the world of Epic Seven.\nNow that you have a clear understanding of how to use your Breath of Orbis effectively, go ahead and upgrade your Sanctuary to unlock its full potential. Happy gaming!\n","wordCount":"758","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sergio Cohen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/epic-seven-breath-of-orbis-upgrade-order/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Epic Seven Guide: Sanctuary + Breath of Orbis - How and Where to Use??</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 8, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;758 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sergio Cohen</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-the-importance-of-breath-of-orbis>1.
