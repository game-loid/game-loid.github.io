In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into everything you need to know about Sigmarus, the Water Phoenix. From where to use her and understanding her skills, to fusing her and the best runes for her, we’ll cover it all. Sigmarus is an exceptional monster for early to mid-game players and is highly versatile, making her a top-tier unit.\nOverview of Skills Sigmarus possesses three unique skills that contribute to her exceptional performance in various areas of the game. Let’s take a closer look at each of these skills:\nArcane Blast (First Skill): Sigmarus attacks the enemy with mysterious energy and stuns them for one turn with an 18% chance. After skill ups, the chance of stunning increases to 48%. This skill not only deals significant damage but also inflicts a bonus stun, making it highly valuable.\nFrozen Orb (Second Skill): With Frozen Orb, Sigmarus attacks with extreme chill, dealing damage proportional to the enemy’s max HP and freezing them for one turn on a critical hit. This skill has a cooldown of two turns after skill ups, making it an effective crowd control tool.\nIce Volcano (Third Skill): Sigmarus unleashes an ice volcano, attacking all enemies and inflicting damage based on their max HP. This skill also decreases the enemy’s attack power for two turns and freezes them for one turn upon landing a critical hit. Ice Volcano has a cool-down time of four turns after skill ups.\nTo maximize Sigmarus’s potential, it is essential to fully skill her up, not only for increased damage output but also for the stun effect on her first skill, which remains useful in mid-game PvP battles.\nSigmarus Fusion To obtain Sigmarus, you will need to complete a fusion process, which involves awakening and fusing several specific monsters. Here is a breakdown of the fusion monsters required:\nArang (Wind Nine-Tailed Fox): Awakened and 5-star max level. Jojo (Fire Joker): Awakened and 5-star max level. Susanoo (Water Ninja): Awakened and 5-star max level. Mina (Water Martial Cat): Awakened and 5-star max level. Please note that Mina needs to be fully awakened for this fusion process. To awaken Sigmarus, you will require 20 High Water Essences, 10 Mid Water Essences, 15 High Magic Essences, and 5 Mid Magic Essences. Once awakened, Sigmarus gains a 15% critical rate increase and becomes even more powerful.\nRune Recommendations Throughout most of the game, it is advisable to focus on providing Sigmarus with Attack, Crit Rate, Crit Damage, and Accuracy. As Sigmarus’s damage output is based on the enemy’s max HP, these rune stats are crucial in dealing maximum damage. Additionally, some accuracy is necessary for her skills to freeze and stun opponents. As you progress further into the game, consider adding a bit of speed to enhance Sigmarus’s efficiency in PvP battles.\nHere are our recommended rune sets for Sigmarus:\nEarly Game: Fatal or Rage with Blade or Focus. Late Game: Fatal or Rage with Blade or Focus. When choosing sub-stats, prioritize Attack Percentage, Crit Damage, and Crit Rate, if necessary. Remember, the main objective is to maximize Sigmarus’s damage potential to overcome the high HP of dungeon bosses.\nStrengths and Weaknesses Now let’s explore Sigmarus’s strengths and weaknesses in Summoners War:\nStrengths:\nExcellent for beginners in GB10 (Giant’s Keep) and DB10 (Dragon’s Lair). High base attack and damage based on enemy’s max HP, making her effective against high-HP bosses. Leader skill increases the HP of all monsters in dungeons by 44%. Suitable for early game arena offense, acting as a second Lucian substitute. Weaknesses:\nNot recommended for PvP battles and late-endgame content. Susceptible to counters due to her easy predictability. Low base speed, hindering her performance in PvP battles. If you’re looking for information on what monsters to use alongside Sigmarus, check the links below to access the best GB10 and DB10 guides that will guide you through these dungeons. We have also included links to other dungeons in case you’re facing challenges in those areas.\nThat concludes our comprehensive guide on Sigmarus, the Water Phoenix. We hope you have learned something valuable today.

Sigmarus is an exceptional monster for early to mid-game players, and understanding how to best utilize her can significantly improve your gameplay experience.
