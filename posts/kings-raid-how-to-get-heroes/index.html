If you’re new to the game or coming from other similar games, you might be wondering how to summon heroes and build your team. In this article, we will discuss the different ways to get heroes and provide you with valuable tips and tricks to start your King’s Raid journey on the right foot.\nKey Points: Introduction to King’s Raid and its hero acquisition system. The two main ways to obtain heroes: purchasing them with gems or starting a relationship with them. Exploring the hero relationship system and its significance. Understanding the time and effort required to fully form a relationship with each hero. Tips on selecting and prioritizing heroes. A glimpse into the hero shop and the range of heroes available for purchase. The importance of saving up gems and strategizing your hero acquisitions. Additional advice and future guidance. Introduction to King’s Raid: King’s Raid, developed by Best Book, is a popular mobile game that has gained immense popularity over the past few years. In this game, players embark on an epic journey and assemble a team of powerful heroes to save the world from darkness. The game offers stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a unique hero-acquisition system that sets it apart from other similar games.\nWays to Obtain Heroes: In King’s Raid, there are two primary methods to obtain heroes: purchasing them with gems or starting a relationship with them. Let’s delve into each of these methods and understand how they work.\nPurchasing Heroes with Gems: One way to obtain heroes in King’s Raid is by purchasing them with gems. Gems are the premium in-game currency that can be obtained through various gameplay activities. By visiting the in-game store, you can browse through a wide range of heroes available for purchase. The store offers a selection of both new and existing heroes, allowing you to choose the ones that align with your playstyle and preferences.\nStarting a Relationship with Heroes: The second way to acquire heroes is by starting a relationship with them. Unlike games where hero summonings are common, King’s Raid takes a different approach. By visiting the heroes’ inn, you can start a relationship with a hero of your choice. However, it’s important to note that once you start a relationship with a hero, you cannot begin another one until you have fully formed your existing relationship.\nTo nurture the relationship with your chosen hero, you can perform daily actions such as greeting, giving gifts, and providing monetary support. As you continue to build the kinship bar, the hero will gradually join your team, and the process of forming relationships will repeat itself. This mechanic adds depth and immersion to the gameplay, requiring players to invest time and effort into their heroes.\nTime and Effort Required: The time and effort required to fully form relationships with heroes vary depending on their initial star rating. Heroes that are two-star originally in the store usually take approximately two to two-and-a-half weeks to form a complete relationship. On the other hand, heroes that are three-star originally in the store may take around three weeks. It’s crucial to carefully consider which heroes to form relationships with, as it can greatly impact your overall gameplay experience.\nFurthermore, it’s worth mentioning that after obtaining a hero, it takes a significant commitment to fully transcendence them to level two. King’s Raid emphasizes the importance of grinding levels, achieving transcendence, and evolving your heroes. This unique aspect sets it apart from other games and adds a layer of complexity and strategy to the hero progression system.\nTips for Selecting and Prioritizing Heroes: When it comes to selecting and prioritizing heroes in King’s Raid, it’s crucial to consider various factors. Here are some tips to help you make informed decisions:\nResearch and understand each hero’s abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Determine your desired playstyle and choose heroes that complement it. Consider team synergy and choose heroes that work well together. Prioritize heroes based on the game’s current meta and popular strategies. Strive for a balanced team composition that covers various roles and positions. The Hero Shop: The hero shop in King’s Raid is a treasure trove of heroes waiting to be discovered. To access the hero shop, navigate to the special shop section, typically located in the bottom middle of the game interface. Once inside the hero shop, you will find a collection of heroes available for purchase using gems. The shop frequently updates its inventory, introducing new heroes and providing players with exciting opportunities to expand their hero pool.\nAs you progress through the game, you will accumulate gems, allowing you to acquire heroes from the shop without relying solely on hero relationships. Plan your gem expenditure wisely to ensure you can seize the opportunity to obtain heroes that best suit your gameplay style.\nConclusion and Future Guidance: Congratulations on mastering the art of obtaining heroes in King’s Raid! This article has provided you with a comprehensive guide on how to obtain heroes, including tips on forming relationships, heroic timeframes, and the hero shop. Remember, King’s Raid is a game that requires dedication, patience, and strategic thinking.
