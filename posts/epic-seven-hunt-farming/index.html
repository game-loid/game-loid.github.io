In this article, we will compare the benefits of farming in the Unrecorded History mode versus Hunt 13 during a buff event, helping you make an informed decision based on your needs. Whether you’re aiming to accumulate gold quickly or searching for specific loot, we’ve got you covered.\nUnderstanding the Basics Before we dive into the details, let’s establish some key information. For the purpose of this comparison, we will focus on Banshee 13, the speaker’s fastest hunt, which has a 100% success rate. Each run takes approximately 45 seconds, including a 5-second countdown timer and loading screens. With this run-time, it is estimated that he can complete about 80 runs per hour.\nOn the other hand, Unrecorded History Level 30 is highlighted as having the fastest clear rate. Levels 30 through 33 offer the same level of rewards, but for speed and gold efficiency, level 30 is recommended. The speaker ran both hunts and averaged their income rates per hour and per stamina.\nBuffs to Consider It is important to note the various buffs that affect your farming efficiency. Guild buffs, specifically the ones that boost experience and gold, should be active to maximize your gains. Additionally, using the bonus experience artifact and purchasing the $5 monthly pack, which provides an experience boost, can further enhance your results.\nDuring the buff event being discussed, all event buffs are active. These buffs include one that boosts hunts and another that boosts HP, creating an opportune time for comparison.\nOptimizing Your Sanctuary To maximize your gold earnings, it is crucial to consider your Sanctuary layout. In the speaker’s case, they have 3 areas focused on the Forest of Souls, which increases the cost of summoning penguins to 120 stigma per summon. After spending 250,000 stigma, it was determined that, on average, each stigma equated to 91.33 gold.\nIncreasing the Forest of Souls level can reduce the cost to summon penguins, resulting in an increase in the amount of gold obtained from selling penguins. However, this increase in gold must be weighed against the potential inconvenience of altering your Sanctuary’s layout. It is a personal decision whether the slight increase in gold is worth restructuring for, ranging from 100 million gold to 115 million gold.\nUtilizing Friendship Points In Unrecorded History, players also earn friendship points. These points can be used to purchase additional penguins, with the option to acquire up to five a week. Moreover, the speaker explores the possibility of using friendship points to obtain friendship bookmarks, which can then be used for friendship summons.\nWhile the selling of resulting two-star artifacts may seem insignificant, it can still yield about 10,000 gold. However, the primary focus of friendship summons should be leveling up artifacts rather than solely obtaining gold. That being said, the option still exists to convert these resources into gold for emergency situations.\nHunting in Banshee 13 Moving on to the hunt aspect of the game, the speaker showcases their Banshee team, detailing the units and strategy used to achieve a 100% success rate. With a run-time of 45 seconds, it is estimated that about 4.4 million gold can be obtained per hour from approximately 80 runs. However, it is necessary to expend 20 stamina per run, resulting in an investment of 1,600 stamina per hour, which equals just under 2,800 gold per stamina.\nFor those interested in building a fast hunt team, the speaker provides the option to refer to their Banshee 13 team descriptions, either on their own YouTube channel or by conducting a general search. By doing so, players can acquire the necessary information to build an efficient one-shot team.\nFarming in Unrecorded History Next, the speaker delves into farming in Unrecorded History, focusing specifically on floors 30 through 33, which offer the same rewards. However, floor 30 is favored due to its speed in clearing. It is suggested to utilize friendship units during these runs and equip them with friendship artifacts.\nThe recommended team consists of Arby as the principal clear unit, along with either Free Spirit Tenebria or Lena as secondary clear units. Commander Pavel is then used as the cleanup unit. However, alternatives are presented for those players who do not have Commander Pavel.\nShowcasing the efficiency of this team, the speaker demonstrates how quickly the stages can be cleared using appropriate strategies. Floor 30 is highlighted as the most efficient due to the lack of additional animations and time consumption. Floors 31 and 32 introduce additional challenges with regards to certain boss units, which can slow down the runs. These challenges can be navigated using different strategies or adjusting team compositions.\nConclusions In conclusion, both Hunt 13 and Unrecorded History offer lucrative opportunities to accumulate wealth in Epic Seven. By considering factors such as speed, stamina cost, gold per stamina, and specific loot requirements, players can make an informed decision on which method to prioritize.\nWhether one seeks to accumulate gold rapidly or chase specific resources, the strategies and insights shared in this article should prove invaluable. With careful planning and optimization, reaching the coveted billion gold milestone is certainly within reach.\nNote: This article is based on the content of Tristen Wulf’s YouTube transcript “Get Rich in Epic Seven - Best Place to Farm - Unrecorded History vs Hunt 13 - Over 5m gold per Hour.” The transcript has been paraphrased and restructured to create a unique and informative article.\n","wordCount":"920","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeremiah Hiller"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/epic-seven-hunt-farming/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Get Rich in Epic Seven - Best Place to Farm: Unrecorded History vs Hunt 13</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 29, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;920 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jeremiah Hiller</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#understanding-the-basics>Understanding the Basics</a></li><li><a href=#buffs-to-consider>Buffs to Consider</a></li><li><a href=#optimizing-your-sanctuary>Optimizing Your Sanctuary</a></li><li><a href=#utilizing-friendship-points>Utilizing Friendship Points</a></li><li><a href=#hunting-in-banshee-13>Hunting in Banshee 13</a></li><li><a href=#farming-in-unrecorded-history>Farming in Unrecorded History</a></li><li><a href=#conclusions>Conclusions</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gYWvoxitcZg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p><em>If you&rsquo;re looking to amass a fortune in the popular mobile game Epic Seven, then this guide is for you.
