As a Chinese game developed by a Chinese developer, King of Avalon is dominated by Chinese players. In this article, we will dive into the recent discussions and announcements surrounding these features. We’ll also explore the controversy surrounding the game’s favoritism towards Chinese players and the potential release of new equipment. So, let’s get started!\nKingdom Teleport: A Controversial Topic One of the burning questions in the King of Avalon community is when the kingdoms will be open for teleportation. The Chinese community had discussions about this topic, and a post from the official King of Avalon Chinese website sparked curiosity. The translation roughly states that the kingdoms will be open sometime this year, but it remains unclear what exactly this entails. Some players speculate that it could involve kingdom teleports or urgent kingdoms. However, it is important to note that these speculations may not be accurate.\nIn the past, dead kingdoms were addressed with solutions like fire lands or conquest, which were not well-received by players. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the upcoming update will bring a real kingdom transfer or merge. The general consensus is that dead kingdoms are dead, and there may not be much hope for a meaningful transfer or merge. Until the developers clarify their plans, it is best not to expect any significant changes in this aspect of the game.\nIce Trash and War Wolf: A Comparative Analysis To shed light on the effectiveness of different aspects of the game, we will compare Ice Lord upgrades and their impact on infantry health. We have received screenshots from players who wished to remain anonymous, showcasing their Ice Lord +5 and their Eisler +3. These screenshots reveal that the difference between the two upgrades is not substantial.\nFor example, let’s focus on infantry health. The Ice Lord +5 has 1081 infantry health, while the Eisler +3 has 1043. Additionally, the Ice Lord +5 has 1056 infantry health, while the Eisler +3 has 1103. The difference is minimal and hardly noticeable. However, it is essential to consider the City Buff and the Lortel activation. If these factors are not taken into account, the Ice Lord upgrade may not provide a significant advantage over the Eisler upgrade.\nIn fact, the City Buff, which requires spending some gold, can almost compensate for the boost provided by the Ice Lord upgrade. This implies that a player who focuses on maximizing the City Buff effect can bridge the gap between the two upgrades without investing heavily in the Ice Lord upgrade.\nTherefore, it is crucial for players to be mindful of all the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of an upgrade. Simply investing a large sum of money into Ice Lord upgrades may not guarantee a significant advantage over other players who strategically utilize City Buffs and other game elements.\nThe Release of New Equipment: An Unpredictable Timeline Players are eager to know when new equipment will be released in the game. However, the game’s release schedule is not always straightforward. It seems that the release of new equipment is intertwined with player spending habits.\nFor example, players have noticed that the price of certain packages has decreased significantly, such as the $100 package now being sold for $20. This indicates that the developers are trying to maximize revenue by enticing players to continue spending on the existing equipment. Once player spending decreases, a new equipment release may be on the horizon.\nThe timing of new equipment releases is unpredictable, and players are advised to be cautious when making purchases. It is possible that new equipment may render their current investments obsolete, leading to a sense of regret and wasted resources. The game’s economy is constantly evolving, and players must adapt accordingly to make informed decisions about their investments.\nAddressing Favoritism and Scamming A recurring concern among players is the apparent favoritism towards Chinese players in King of Avalon. It is frustrating for non-Chinese players to see important announcements and discussions limited to the Chinese community without translation or clarification for the wider player base. This lack of transparency fuels the perception of unfair treatment and exclusion.\nPlayers are encouraged to voice their concerns and frustrations regarding these issues. By leaving comments and engaging in discussions, players can make a collective impact and demand equal treatment for all. The developers rely on player feedback to improve the game, and a strong response from the community may prompt them to address these concerns.\nConclusion In this article, we delved into the hot topics of kingdom teleportation, ice trash, and War Wolf details in King of Avalon. We analyzed the controversies surrounding these features, including the potential favoritism towards Chinese players and the uncertain release of new equipment. It is essential for players to stay informed, consider all factors, and participate in discussions to shape the future of the game. By voicing their concerns, players can advocate for fairness, transparency, and a better gaming experience for everyone. Remember to stay engaged, be vigilant with your investments, and most importantly, enjoy the game!\n","wordCount":"857","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jacob Secrest"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/king-of-avalon-teleport/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Kingdom Teleport, Ice Trash, and War Wolf Details: A Comprehensive Analysis - King of Avalon</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 5, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;857 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jacob Secrest</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#kingdom-teleport-a-controversial-topic>Kingdom Teleport: A Controversial Topic</a></li><li><a href=#ice-trash-and-war-wolf-a-comparative-analysis>Ice Trash and War Wolf: A Comparative Analysis</a></li><li><a href=#the-release-of-new-equipment-an-unpredictable-timeline>The Release of New Equipment: An Unpredictable Timeline</a></li><li><a href=#addressing-favoritism-and-scamming>Addressing Favoritism and Scamming</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WO127k7HrJo style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Kingdom teleportation, ice trash, and War Wolf details are hot topics in the King of Avalon community.
