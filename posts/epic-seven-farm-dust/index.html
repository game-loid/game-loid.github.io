In today’s guide, we will be discussing the artifacts that you can safely sell for Powder of Knowledge. As the game introduces more limited and collaboration artifacts, it’s important to have enough Powder of Knowledge to purchase these valuable items. By selling artifacts that are not essential to your gameplay, you can accumulate more Powder of Knowledge. In this guide, I will provide you with a list of artifacts that you can safely sell, as well as those that you should keep for their usefulness in either PvE or PvP battles.\nImportance of Limited and Collab Artifacts Before we dive into the list, it’s crucial to note that you should always keep one copy of limited and collab artifacts, especially if they are five-star artifacts. These artifacts often have the potential to be buffed in the future, and if you don’t own them, you might miss out on their improved versions. Limited collab artifacts, in particular, may not return in the future due to contractual agreements. So, keeping one copy of these artifacts is highly recommended to avoid regrets later on.\nFive-Star Artifacts Although five-star artifacts are generally valuable and should be kept, there may be instances where you can sell one or two artifacts to acquire a highly desirable artifact from the Powder of Knowledge shop. If you have excess artifacts that you aren’t currently using and don’t plan to use in the near future, trading them for a powerful artifact that you can immediately use may be more beneficial than holding onto them for potential future buffs. However, exercise caution and consider the value of the artifact before making this decision.\nFour-Star Artifacts Now, let’s move on to the four-star artifacts. I will provide you with a list of artifacts that are safe to sell and those that you should keep for their strength and usefulness:\nToggle Hell - Keep as many copies as you can. Do not sell. Kal’adra - Keep one or two max Limit Break (LB) copies for PvE purposes. Sierra Ren - Safe to sell. Not strong enough in my opinion. Barthez’s Orb - Safe to sell. Not strong enough. Aurius - Keep all copies. Useful for various units. Adamant Shield - Keep all copies. Adamant Armor - Keep all copies. Pillar of the North - Safe to sell. Not recommended for early to mid game. Steadfast Gatekeeper - Keep one or two max LB copies. Pillow of Life - Safe to sell. El’s Fist - Safe to sell. Hell Cutter - Keep two copies. Very strong artifact. Strategus’ Gauntlet - Safe to sell. Moonlight Dreamblade - Never sell. Extremely powerful artifact. Elbris Ritual Sword - Keep one or two copies. Alexa’s Basket - Safe to sell unless you need it for your Ranger’s Vial (RV) unit. Song of Stars - Safe to sell. Not necessary for PvE. Furious - Keep for PvE purposes. Dust Devil - Safe to sell unless you love using Kayron. Silver Rain - Safe to sell. Weak artifact. Water’s Origin - Keep three or four max LV copies if you use Soul Weavers. Potion Vial - Keep two max LB copies. Magaraha’s Tome - Keep all copies. Very strong artifact for Soul Weavers. The Sword of Judgment - Safe to sell. Not recommended. Molagora’s Skin - Safe to sell. SS Achates’ Scepter - Safe to sell. Rosa Hargana - Safe to sell unless you don’t have Drink on Surin-Stealth-Basket (SSB). Ambrote - Safe to sell. Limited artifact. Charles’ Secret Recipe - Safe to sell. Crossbow of the Graceful - Safe to sell. Everything else - Limited, collab, or event artifacts. Keep them all. Three-Star Artifacts Lastly, let’s discuss the three-star artifacts. Since these artifacts are relatively easy to obtain, do not hesitate to sell them for Powder of Knowledge. However, there are a few strong three-star artifacts that you should keep:\nProphetic Candlestick - Keep at least two or three copies. Useful for defense teams. Ancient Sheath - Keep one max LB copy. Useful in Abyss floors. Alsatian Spear - Keep one copy. Can be beneficial in some expedition units. Cursed Compass - Keep multiple copies. Very powerful for debuffers. Daydream Joker - Keep at least six max LB copies. Excellent artifact for PvE. Exorcist’s Tonfa - Safe to sell if you have Portrait of the Savior. Otherwise, keep one. Timeless Anchor - Keep one or two copies. Valuable for select units. Both Keys - Keep multiple copies. Useful against opposite element units and counters Moonlight Dreamblade. Two-Star and One-Star Artifacts - Do not sell. Use for artifact fodder as acquiring artifact charms is challenging in the game. Conclusion That wraps up our comprehensive guide on artifacts in Epic Seven. Remember, it’s essential to keep limited and collab artifacts, as well as five-star artifacts for potential future buffs. However, you can freely sell four-star and three-star artifacts that are not essential to your gameplay. By selling unnecessary artifacts, you can accumulate more Powder of Knowledge to obtain the artifacts you truly need. I hope this guide has been helpful in managing your artifacts effectively.
