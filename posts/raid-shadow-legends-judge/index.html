These champions are especially valuable in areas such as the Doom Tower and secret rooms. Although some of these champions may have been featured in previous videos, this list focuses on rare champions that excel in end game content. Let’s delve deeper into each champion’s unique abilities and why they are considered top-tier options for players.\nJudge Judge is a highly sought-after rare champion due to her exceptional damage potential. Her A1 ability increases damage by 10 for each debuff on the target. Additionally, her A2 ability attacks enemies twice and fills her turn meter by 10 for each critical hit. With a stun set, Judge becomes an invaluable asset to a team.\nElhain Elhain, one of the starting champions, is a powerhouse in the end game. Her multiple AoE abilities make her an excellent choice for stun sets. With an AoE on her A2 and A3 abilities, she proves to be one of the best stun champions in the game.\nKael Kael is a versatile champion that excels in early, mid, and end game content. His AoE abilities, combined with poison effects, make him a formidable damage dealer. With a turn meter fill on his A2 ability, Kael can unleash devastating attacks more frequently.\nGreybeard Greybeard is a crowd control specialist with his provoke ability on his A1 and an AoE freeze on his A2. While his defense and dungeons abilities may not be as useful in end game content, Greybeard’s overall kit makes him a valuable addition to any team. He is also campaign farmable, making him easily obtainable.\nKhazard Khazard is particularly effective in Doom Tower and difficult rare rooms. As an avoid affinity champion, he brings two strong AoE attacks to the table. His A2 ability fills turn meters, while his A3 ability decreases defense on all enemies. Khazard’s increased accuracy is advantageous in various scenarios, including faction wars.\nApothecary Apothecary is a rare champion that you can utilize in various aspects of the game, from Doom Tower secret rooms to Clan Boss battles. With his two-turn heal and speed increase, he serves as an essential support champion. His turn meter fill ability further enhances his utility.\nColdheart Coldheart is an endgame beast and is arguably the best rare champion in the game. With her AoE attack on her A2 ability and a full turn meter depletion on her A3 ability, Coldheart excels in Fire Knight, Spider, and Doom Tower secret rooms. She is a powerhouse that deals massive damage based on the enemy’s max HP.\nRelickeeper Relickeeper is a rare reviver with a full cleanse ability on a three-turn cooldown. With continuous heal and a decrease attack on his A1, he is a valuable support champion. Although not featured in the list, Geargrinder also deserves an honorable mention as a decent revival and healing champion for end game content.\nExecutioner Executioner sees a lot of use in end game teams due to his stun abilities. His A1 and A2 abilities both have a chance to stun enemies. Additionally, his A2 ability has an AoE decrease speed, making him incredibly useful for stunning and crowd control.\nRenegade Renegade is one of the top rare champions that can reset the cooldowns of all ally skills. Alongside Prince Kymar, she is highly valued for end game speed runs and various battles. With her void affinity, she remains viable even at level 50.\nWarmaiden Warmaiden stands out as the best debuffer among all rare champions. Her A3 ability decreases defense on a three-turn cooldown, making her invaluable in end game content. Even though her A3 has a 75% land rate, she still outperforms other rare debuffers.\nSoulbound Bowyer Soulbound Bowyer brings a unique skill set to the table. Her A1 ability is an AoE attack, making her an excellent candidate for a stun or retaliation set. Her A2 and A3 abilities deal significant damage and are particularly useful for ignoring enemy defense and depleting their turn meter.\nBerserker Berserker is another rare champion known for his AoE attacks. His A3 ability ignores 20% of each target’s defense, making him suitable for Doom Tower secret rooms. Although his four-turn cooldown is a drawback, he compensates with high damage output and turn meter fill on critical hits.\nBanshee Banshee is a rare champion with AoE abilities that excel in removing buffs. Her A1 ability decreases defense, while her A2 ability has a chance to remove a buff from each target. With a two-turn cooldown on her A2, she can continuously remove buffs, making her a strong asset in end game battles.\nIn conclusion, these 18 rare champions are must-haves for end game content in RAID Shadow Legends. Whether you’re tackling the Doom Tower, secret rooms, or other challenging battles, these champions will undoubtedly enhance your team’s performance. With their unique abilities and versatility, they bring a winning edge to your squad.
