There’s an unbelievable offer that you need to know about. In this article, we will delve into the details of this offer and discuss the best characters to use gold promotion credits on. We will also explore how these characters hold value in the future. Stay tuned as we reveal the characters we have already promoted to red stars.\nBut first, let’s talk about the offer itself. Costing just $20, this offer includes 2000 gold promotion credits, three Elite sixes, and one Elite seven. It is similar to the calendars you may have seen in games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. However, this one will last for a whopping 100 days. Scopely wants you to focus on Marvel Strike Force, and this offer will help you catch up with the whales in the game.\nNow, let’s dive into the characters. When considering which characters to promote, there are certain factors you should take into account. Does the character deal damage or provide healing with their abilities? Do they apply negative effects to enemies? Can they provide healing or damage outside of their own turn? Do they have game-changing effects like stuns, traumas, or ability blocks? Can they heal themselves on their turn? These factors will help you determine which characters are worth promoting to 6 or 7 red stars.\nOne such character is Kang. He applies tons of negative effects, heals himself, and deals insane amounts of damage. Other characters worth considering include Modular, Gambit, Cersei, Agatha, Dark Beast, Omega Red, Black Panther, Kestrel, Spider-Weaver, and Shang-Chi. These characters possess multiple factors mentioned earlier, making them great choices for red stars.\nMoving on, we have the New Warriors. Dagger, who deals piercing damage, applies negative effects, and heals herself, should be on your radar. Firestarter, who attacks outside of her turn, and Deadpool, who gains value if you can kill enemies, are also worthy of consideration.\nAnother powerful team is the Infinity Watch. Gamora, with additional turns and the ability to flip positive effects into negative ones, is a solid choice. Phyla-Vell, who gives barrier and drain, and Moonstone, who removes positive effects and heals, are essential for keeping the team alive. And let’s not forget Adam Warlock, Nebula, and Moondragon. These characters are all recommended for promotion to 6 or 7 red stars.\nDon’t overlook Nemesis either. Alongside Dark Beast, Nemesis is great for raids, Dark Dimension, Cosmic Crucible, and Alliance War. With his ability to apply negative effects and bleeds, Nemesis is a force to be reckoned with.\nAs you can see, we have already promoted many of these characters ourselves, demonstrating their value. By targeting these characters, you can ensure your roster is solid and ready for any challenge that comes its way.\nIn conclusion, Marvel Strike Force players have an incredible opportunity to catch up to the whales with this offer. By strategically promoting characters with gold promotion credits, you can enhance your roster and dominate the game. Remember to consider the factors mentioned earlier when deciding which characters to invest in. With the right promotions, your team will be unstoppable in Q1/Q2 2023 and beyond.\nIf you found this article informative, don’t forget to share it with your friends on Facebook and Discord.
