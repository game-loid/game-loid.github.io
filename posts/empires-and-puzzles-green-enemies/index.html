Whether you’re a seasoned player or just starting out, it’s essential to understand which heroes are worth investing in. In this guide, we will discuss the top 10 heroes to limit break in the green category. We will cover both five-star and lower star heroes, providing you with a comprehensive overview of their strengths and weaknesses.\nBefore we dive into the heroes, let’s briefly discuss the concept of limit breaking. Limit breaking is a feature in Empires and Puzzles that allows you to enhance your heroes’ stats and abilities beyond their usual limits. By doing this, you can increase their power and effectiveness in battles.\nNow, let’s get to the heroes. We will be grading them on a scale ranging from C to A+, with A+ being the highest rating. Keep in mind that these rankings are subjective and based on our experience and analysis.\nC-range Heroes\nCaitlin: Caitlin is a hero who primarily deals damage to all enemies at a fast speed. While she can provide some defense against special skills, overall, she is underwhelming compared to other heroes.\nAlkanin: Alkanin’s ability is to deal damage to nearby enemies and increase healing. However, this increase in healing is not significant enough to make him a standout hero.\nGuardian Chameleon: This hero can be useful against Mythic Titans, but other than that, he doesn’t offer many exceptional qualities.\nB-Range Heroes\nLady Locke: Lady Locke deals damage over four turns and dispels status ailments from allies. While her damage starts off low, she can be an asset in battles.\nHorghall: Horghall deals damage to all enemies and reduces their attack for a duration. His key strength lies in his attack reduction ability, which can be beneficial for six turns.\nZocc: Zocc is a hero who deals damage to a single target and potentially sets up an increase in mana for that target. However, his abilities can be a bit messy and lack focus.\nElradir: Elradir deals damage to nearby enemies and has a chance to reflect status ailments. While he has some promising traits, he doesn’t see much play outside of specific situations.\nHorghall Costume: Horghall’s costume provides additional attack decrease, making him a better version of his regular self.\nB+ Heroes\nMorgan Le Fay: Morgan Le Fay deals fast damage while draining life and increasing her defense against fire. While she used to be a formidable hero, recent power creep has diminished her impact.\nGregorion: Gregorion is primarily used against Titans due to his critical chance ability. However, he doesn’t excel in other areas of the game.\nMargaret: Margaret received a buff that improved her abilities, but she still falls short compared to other dodge-focused heroes.\nLady of the Lake: Lady of the Lake is widely used in very fast wars because her minion reduction ability is incredibly frustrating for opponents.\nJade: Jade is an underwhelming ninja hero who relies on dodge mechanics but lacks damage-dealing capabilities.\nTelluria: Telluria was once a top-tier hero but has been heavily nerfed. While she still serves as a decent tank, she lacks offensive capabilities.\nLady of the Lake Costume: This version of Lady of the Lake provides negative mana generation, making her even more annoying to face in battles.\nThe Hatter: The Hatter is a useful hero for stealing buffs, but beyond that, he doesn’t offer much.\nTarlak: Tarlak is primarily used against titans due to his damage increase ability. However, he doesn’t offer much flexibility outside of that specific role.\nA-Range Heroes\nLianna: Lianna deals massive damage to a single target and can be devastating when limit broken.\nZeline: Zeline is a versatile hero who dispels buffs from enemies and deals damage with an attack decrease.\nAtomos: Atomos got a buff that improved his abilities, but he is still not commonly seen in gameplay.\nLianna Costume: Lianna’s costume provides her with additional mana generation reduction, making her a stronger version of her regular self.\nElkanen Costume: Elkanen’s costume deals damage to targets and nearby enemies, along with providing substantial healing gain.\nGargantuar: Gargantuar deals damage and provides regeneration over three turns. While useful, he doesn’t stand out as a top-tier hero.\nEiora \u0026 Fluffy: This hero excels at dealing damage to minions and reducing minion summoning. With the rise of minion heroes, Eiora \u0026 Fluffy could become even more valuable.\nFrancine Costume: Francine’s costume allows her to deal damage to targets and nearby enemies while offering cleansing abilities and defensive down effects.\nKongalak: Kongalak is a new hero who shows promise but needs further evaluation due to his slow speed.\nEvelyn: Evelyn deals damage to targets and nearby enemies, dispels buffs, and provides nature defense down. She is a versatile hero with multiple beneficial abilities.\nThree-Star and Four-Star Heroes\nFor those on a budget or starting out in the game, here are a few three-star and four-star heroes worth considering:\nIshtak Costume: This hero deals damage to targets and nearby enemies while reducing defense.\nGrevle: Grevle’s health-boosting ability can be valuable in wars and offers an attack increase.\nBerden Costume: Berden’s costume deals damage and reduces the defense of targets for an extended duration.\nCarver: Carver deals damage to all enemies and reduces their mana, making him a surprising contender.\nChoosing the right heroes to limit break in Empires and Puzzles can greatly impact your gameplay. Consider the abilities and strengths of each hero before making your decision. Experiment with different combinations and strategies to find the ones that suit your playstyle best.\nRemember, this guide provides a subjective analysis based on our experience and knowledge of the game. Empires and Puzzles is a dynamic game where new heroes are constantly being introduced, and balance changes are made. Stay updated with the latest hero releases and balance adjustments to make informed decisions about limit breaking.\nDo you want to take your gameplay to the next level? Consider joining the top 100 alliance “Too Tough for Titans.” With a recent top 3 ranking in the world and 14-star titan chains, they are a force to be reckoned with. Contact Resix Corey on LINE to join the waitlist and elevate your gameplay.\nIn conclusion, understanding which heroes to limit break in Empires and Puzzles is essential for success. Consider the rankings and insights provided in this guide to make informed decisions. Remember, the game is constantly evolving, so stay up to date with changes and new hero releases. With the right heroes and strategic gameplay, you’ll rise to the top of the leaderboard in no time.\n","wordCount":"1104","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandra Barnard"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/empires-and-puzzles-green-enemies/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Top 10 Heroes to Limit Break in Green Empires and Puzzles: A Comprehensive Guide</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 19, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1104 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sandra Barnard</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qs3lc0s2MEM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>In the world of Empires and Puzzles, choosing the right heroes to limit break can make a significant difference in your gameplay.
