With all these changes, players are left wondering which build is the best for their playstyle. In this article, we will explore the different builds available in Tap Titans 2 version 5.10 and provide you with the ultimate guide to help you choose the best build for your playstyle.\nBefore we dive into the different build options, it’s essential to note that there are two main categories of builds: power push builds and speed farming builds. Power push builds focus on maximizing your pushing power to reach higher stages, while speed farming builds prioritize speed and efficiency for events or farming purposes.\nNow, let’s explore the different builds and their rankings based on their effectiveness and efficiency:\nDagger Build: Surprisingly, the dagger build has emerged as the top build in terms of power. It has the potential to push players two and a half to three thousand stages in a single day. In contrast, other builds, such as heavy strike, couldn’t even reach the current max stage. Therefore, the dagger build is highly recommended for players seeking maximum pushing power.\nClan Ship Pet Build: The clan ship pet build comes in second place in terms of power, closely behind the dagger build. While it may not be as strong, it offers faster gameplay, making it an excellent choice for players who prioritize speed over raw power.\nShadow Clone Gold Build: The shadow clone gold build is ideal for players looking for a passive and speedy farming build. Although it may not have the same pushing power as other builds, it is efficient for farming events or collecting gold quickly.\nHeavy Strike Build: Once considered a decent pushing build, the heavy strike build has lost its power in the 5.10 update and now ranks at the bottom of the list. It may provide fast gameplay, but it lacks the pushing power needed to compete with other builds in the current version.\nNow that we have covered the rankings, let’s take a closer look at each build and its recommended skill tree, equipment, and playstyle:\nDagger Build:\nSkill Tree: The skill tree for the dagger build focuses on maximizing damage and crit chance. It is recommended to invest heavily in skills like Light Strike, Cloaking, Love Potion, and Anchoring Shot. Equipment: Optimal equipment for the dagger build includes Tap Damage swords, Gun Blade helmets, Chesterson Gold chests, and Heavy Strike slash boosts. Playstyle: The dagger build relies on high damage output and critical hits. With the right skill tree and equipment, players can achieve substantial pushing power. Clan Ship Pet Build:\nSkill Tree: In the clan ship pet build, players should prioritize skills like Astral Awakening, Silent March, and Midas Ultimate. These skills enhance the power and efficiency of the clan ship and pet damage. Equipment: The ideal equipment for this build includes Tap Damage swords, Chesterson Gold helmets, Gold Armor chests, and Pet Damage slash boosts. Playstyle: The clan ship pet build strikes a balance between power and speed, making it versatile for both pushing and farming purposes. Shadow Clone Gold Build:\nSkill Tree: The skill tree for the shadow clone gold build focuses on boosting gold and pet damage. Key skills include Heart of Midas, Aerial Assault, and Rogue tree skills. Equipment: For this build, players should equip Tap Damage swords, Gun Blade helmets, Chesterson Gold chests, and Shadow Clone slash boosts. Playstyle: The shadow clone gold build provides a passive and speedy farming experience, making it ideal for players who prefer efficient gold collection. Heavy Strike Build:\nSkill Tree: While the heavy strike build is no longer the most effective option, players can still experiment with skills like Heavenly Strike, Anchoring Shot, and Angelic Radiance for fast-paced gameplay. Equipment: Recommended equipment for this build includes Tap Damage swords, Gun Blade helmets, Gold Armor chests, and Heavy Strike slash boosts. Playstyle: Despite its lack of pushing power in the current version, the heavy strike build offers fast gameplay, making it suitable for events or farming purposes. To maximize the effectiveness of your chosen build, it is crucial to join a high-level clan for additional benefits and advanced stage starts. Additionally, having the right equipment sets, such as the Noble Fencer set, can boost your build’s performance.\nLastly, it’s important to note that the skill point investment and playstyle may vary depending on your total skill points, passive skills, and mana regeneration. Adjust your build accordingly and consider the recommendations provided based on the assumption of having around 4,000 skill points.\nBy following this comprehensive guide, you can make an informed decision on which build to choose in Tap Titans 2 version 5.10. Remember to experiment, find the build that suits your playstyle the best, and enjoy the thrilling journey of continuously pushing your limits in this exciting mobile game.\nResources:\nInterested in further optimizing your gameplay?
