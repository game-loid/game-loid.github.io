In today’s article, we will be diving into the best possible ways to utilize the powerful hero, Dorian. By understanding the importance of Hero placement and synergy within a team, you will discover the incredible potential that Dorian brings to your strategies. So, let’s not waste any more time and get right into it!\nUnderstanding Dorian’s Abilities Dorian, as a backline hero, offers a unique physical attack boost to the team through his artifact weapon. However, it’s crucial to note that his usefulness goes beyond just physical attackers. His most potent skill is his fourth skill, which provides a Vampirism Aura to the nearest allies. This means that the closest allies will heal themselves each time they attack, with the amount of healing increasing based on the strength of their strikes.\nOptimizing Hero Placement Considering Dorian’s placement in your team is of utmost importance. Instead of focusing on managing front line heroes, it is recommended to bring in backline or middle line damage dealers who can benefit from Dorian’s abilities. By positioning heroes like Andy and a tank in front of Dorian, you can take advantage of Dorian’s Aura, ultimately strengthening your team. However, it’s vital to strike a balance between optimizing placement and not compromising the overall effectiveness of your team.\nThe Role of Hero Placement Understanding the mechanics of the game is crucial when strategizing with Dorian. Your heroes’ placement directly impacts their vulnerability to opponents’ attacks. If your team’s placement is inefficient or easily counterable, you risk giving your opponents an advantage. For example, if you have all front line heroes, it creates an awkward team placement, making it easy for opponents’ heroes like Single Arachni to stun or eliminate your team.\nSynergy with AOE Damage Dealers Dorian truly shines when paired with heroes who deal area of effect (AOE) damage. Heroes such as Iris, Ziri, Lilith, Kira, Helios, and Orion work exceptionally well with Dorian. Even if opponents turn your damage dealers, they will continue to gain health points constantly, thanks to Dorian’s healing abilities. The combination of Dorian and Iris, for instance, emerges as a perfect duo, ensuring your damage dealers are constantly healthy. Additionally, heroes like Ziri and Lilith become incredibly effective when teamed up with Dorian due to his healing aura.\nSingle Target Damage Dealers While AOE damage dealers benefit the most from Dorian’s abilities, single target damage dealers should not be overlooked. Heroes like E-DD, E3-D, and Ginger Isaac can still be very useful in conjunction with Dorian. These heroes possess powerful finishing skills that can quickly eliminate opponents. Paired with Dorian’s healing aura, their effectiveness on the battlefield is enhanced.\nConsider Penetration and Artifacts When considering the addition of Dorian to your team, it is crucial to evaluate the balance between advantages and disadvantages. Do you have sufficient penetration in your team to counter opponents’ armor and magic defense? Are you replacing a hero with penetration abilities for Dorian?\nFor example, in Kira’s case, it is common practice to remove her penetration weapon, Murray Gun, when adding Dorian to the team. However, it is essential to assess whether this decision is wise, as penetration is crucial in certain situations. When building an IRS team, you might consider replacing Phobos RS with Lilith for penetration, or even Tristan with Kira for added penetration. By ensuring a proper balance, you can maintain strong hero positions while still benefiting from Dorian’s presence.\nRecap and Conclusion To summarize, optimizing hero placement is vital when utilizing Dorian’s abilities effectively. AOE damage dealers show excellent synergy with Dorian, though single-target damage dealers can also be valuable additions. When adding Dorian to your team, carefully consider the balance between advantages and disadvantages, ensuring you have enough penetration to break through opponents’ defenses.\nThat brings us to the end of this article!
