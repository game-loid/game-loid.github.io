Upgrading your heroes is crucial for strengthening your team and improving your chances of winning battles. There are several key points to consider when upgrading your heroes, and we will cover them in detail to ensure you fully understand the process.\nImportance of Stars The first and most important aspect to consider when upgrading your heroes is their star rating. Stars have a significant impact on a hero’s performance in battles. When fighting with the same hero, but with different star ratings, the hero with more stars has a higher chance of winning. For example, a hero with three stars will outperform a hero with only one or two stars.\nHowever, there are some exceptions to this rule. Certain heroes, like Martha, become stronger even without upgrading their stars. Martha’s abilities rely on her star rating, and if she has a low star rating, she will be more prone to damage and be less effective in battle.\nUpgrading Hero Skills After considering the star rating, the next step is to upgrade your hero’s skills. Upgrading skills is crucial for improving a hero’s effectiveness in battles. The skill level of a hero depends on their hero level, not their star rating. To upgrade a hero’s skill level, you can use gold or Championship Coins to purchase Evolution Boosters.\nThe Importance of Tiers Moving on, we come to the importance of upgrading a hero’s tier. Tiers represent the overall power and strength of a hero. By progressing further in the game’s campaign mode, you will unlock higher-tier items, which can significantly enhance your hero’s abilities. As you advance in the campaign, you will have access to better equipment and items, improving the overall performance of your heroes.\nUpgrade Hero Artifacts Another aspect of upgrading your heroes is enhancing their artifacts. Artifacts are essential items that contribute to a hero’s overall strength and abilities. Upgrading artifacts can greatly enhance a hero’s performance in battles. It is crucial to prioritize upgrading artifacts that complement your hero’s skills and attributes.\nUpgrading Skins Upgrading your hero’s skin is another way to improve their abilities. Skins add visual enhancements and provide additional bonuses to your hero’s performance. When choosing a skin, consider its compatibility with your hero’s skills and attributes. Upgrading skins can be done using skin soft or skinshop certificates, which can be obtained through gameplay.\nUpgrading Sigils Lastly, we have sigils, which are special enhancements that provide additional states for your heroes. Upgrading sigils can be challenging but rewarding. Titan Poison is required to upgrade sigils and can be obtained from the Titan shop or Dunjen.\nBy following this proper order of upgrading your heroes, you can ensure that each hero reaches their full potential and contributes effectively to your team’s success. Pay attention to star ratings, skill upgrades, tiers, artifacts, skins, and sigils to maximize your hero’s power.\nRemember, upgrading your heroes is an ongoing process. Continuously work towards improving their abilities and stay updated with the latest upgrades and enhancements available in the game.\nIn conclusion, the correct order of upgrading your heroes in Hero Wars is essential for success in battles. By focusing on stars, skills, tiers, artifacts, skins, and sigils, you can ensure that your heroes are fully optimized and ready to take on any challenge. Upgrade wisely and strategically, and dominate the battlefield with your powerful heroes.\nDon’t forget to like, share, and subscribe to our channel for more Hero Wars tips and tricks.
