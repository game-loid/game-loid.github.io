In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know about Royal Capital Azmakalis and the Astma Callus of Cycle in the Labyrinth Raid. This raid has recently undergone a major revamp, so it’s important to stay up-to-date with the changes. We will discuss the basic rules, boss rewards, boss strategies, recommended party compositions, and the shops in the raid. This guide is sponsored by Smilegate, the developers of Epic Seven. Let’s dive in!\nRoyal Capital Azmakalis - A Whole New Raid Experience Previously known as the Normal Raid, Royal Capital Azmakalis has undergone significant changes that make it a one-time clear instead of a weekly reset. Clearing this raid will reward you with Ancient Coins and Queen’s Guard Badges, which will be discussed later in the guide. The rewards have also been increased from level 67 to level 80. It’s important to note that the logistics officer, who was found in this raid, will eventually be phased out. However, she has been left in the game temporarily to allow veteran players to exchange their currency before she leaves forever.\nExploring the Shops in Astma Callus While in Astma Callus, you have the opportunity to explore and test out the different shops, such as the merchants, normal labyrinth, and the vagrant or hoochie shop. One important tip is that you can enter these shops, buy items, and then exit without consuming your compasses or bug charms. However, if you kill bosses or mobs and then exit, you will not receive credit for those kills. To get the actual credit, you need to take a portal. This feature is especially useful for newcomers who want to familiarize themselves with the shops and test out different compositions without consuming their resources.\nRecommended Party Compositions For Royal Capital Azmakalis and most of the cycle, a well-rounded party composition is key to success. The recommended team composition includes Angelica as the tank and backup healer, Commander Lorena for single target damage, Mercedes for area of effect damage, Montmorancy as the main cleanser and healer, and Fire Mercedes for stealth targets. All these units are either free or available in the connection. However, you can swap out units based on your preferences and the boss encounters. Units like DN, Tamarin, and Luna can be great additions to the team. It’s important to have a balance of healing, cleansing, single target damage, and area of effect damage to handle the different bosses in the raid.\nBoss Strategies Royal Capital Azmakalis consists of multiple bosses with varying difficulties. In the one clear version and the normal version of the cycle, the strategy remains largely the same across all bosses. The difficulty increases with higher health and damage for each boss. Some of the bosses you will encounter include Devar Aricon, Executioner Carcanus, Secretary Vera, Jew Leaf Council, and Queen Azamashik. Each boss has its own mechanics and strategies to defeat them. It’s important to focus on staying alive through sustained healing, clearing debuffs, and eliminating the accompanying mobs. The Nightmare mode, which is the most difficult version, requires a completely different strategy. However, for beginners, it’s recommended to focus on clearing the one clear version and the normal version of the cycle first.\nThe Labyrinth Shop In the Labyrinth Raid, you will earn resources that can be used to purchase items from the Labyrinth Shop. These resources include malicious bug charms and labyrinth compasses. Malicious bug charms are used to enter the cycle of Astma Callus, while labyrinth compasses are used to enter raids. It is advisable to prioritize bug charms over compasses, as they can be traded for better rewards in higher difficulty raids. The Labyrinth Shop also offers accessory chests, but it’s recommended to skip these as they provide lower level gear that will be quickly outclassed. Instead, focus on acquiring charms for upgrading your accessories, as gear is crucial for progression in the game.\nNightmare Mode - The Ultimate Challenge While this guide primarily focuses on the beginner aspects of the Labyrinth Raid, it’s worth mentioning the Nightmare mode. Nightmare mode is the ultimate challenge in the raid, and it offers incredible rewards, including rare gear sets. Even though it may seem daunting for beginners, it’s important to start preparing for Nightmare mode early on. Building a strong team with units that have dispel abilities, area of effect damage, and sustained healing will greatly increase your chances of success in Nightmare mode. Keep progressing through the raid and improving your gear to reach this ultimate challenge.\nConclusion Mastering the Labyrinth Raid in Epic Seven requires careful planning, party composition, and strategy. By following this beginner’s guide, you will be well-equipped to tackle the challenges of Royal Capital Azmakalis and the Astma Callus of Cycle. Remember to prioritize healing, cleansing, damage, and teamwork to overcome the different bosses. Stay updated with the changes in the raid and make the most of the resources earned to upgrade your gear. As you progress, strive towards the ultimate challenge of Nightmare mode and reap the rewards it has to offer. Good luck, and may you conquer the Labyrinth Raid!\n(Note: The article has been written in English and contains over 600 words.
