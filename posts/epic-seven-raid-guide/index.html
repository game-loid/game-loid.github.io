In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know about the Royal Capital Azmakalis raid, including the basic rules, boss rewards, boss guides, recommended party compositions, and the shops. This raid has recently undergone significant changes, so it’s important to stay up-to-date.\nBefore we dive into the details, it’s essential to familiarize ourselves with some key points. The Royal Capital Azmakalis raid is now a one-time clear instead of a weekly reset. By completing the raid, you will earn ancient coins and Queen’s Guard badges as rewards. The rewards have also been increased from level 67 to level 80, making it more attractive for newer and returning players.\nIn this mode, there is a logistics officer known as the Coronation Souvenirs vendor. Although you can no longer obtain the coronation souvenirs, she has been left in the game for veterans and returning players to exchange their remaining currency before she is phased out completely.\nIf you wish to explore and test different strategies, party compositions, or check out the merchants in Astmakalis, you can do so without expending your compasses or bug charms. However, keep in mind that if you kill mobs or bosses and then yield out, you won’t receive credit for those kills. To gain credit, you must take a portal.\nNow let’s discuss the team composition that can be used for this raid. For most bosses in the raid, a recommended team composition includes Angelica as the tank, Commander Lorena for single-target damage, Mercedes for area of effect damage, Montmorancy as the main cleanser and healer, and Fire Mercedes for stealth targets. These units are either free or available through connections, making them accessible to all players. Of course, you can make swaps based on your preferences and available units.\nWhile this composition can clear most of the normal version of the raid and the normal version in the cycle, it may need adjustments for the nightmare mode. For higher difficulties, units with defense break, dispels, and access to artifacts will be crucial. Clarissa, Flurry, Falconer Kluri, and Furious are examples of units that possess these abilities. Remember, having a composition with healers, tanks, high single-target damage, and area effect damage will suffice for clearing a majority of the early and middle ground Royal Capital Azmakalis versions.\nNow that we have covered party compositions, let’s jump into the boss encounters in Royal Capital Azmakalis. For the one-clear version and the normal version of the cycle, the strategy remains quite similar across all the bosses. The only difference lies in the increased difficulty levels. The nightmare mode requires a completely different strategy.\nThe first boss you will encounter is Devar Aricon. To defeat him, you must eliminate the two accompanying mobs first. While these mobs are alive, Devar Aricon takes significantly reduced damage. After clearing the mobs, focus all your attacks on Devar Aricon to deal full damage. Maintain sustained healing and clear any debuffs to stay alive.\nExecutioner Carcanus is the next boss you will face, and he hits harder than Devar Aricon. He grants himself stackable increase in attack and speed, making it essential to defeat him as quickly as possible. Additionally, he periodically stealths himself, so it is crucial to have units with area of effect attacks to reveal him.\nSecretary Vera, an Earth element boss, comes after Executioner Carcanus. The strategy for defeating her involves attacking a lot of eggs that hatch and require area of effect damage. Ensure your team consists of units capable of continuous area of effect damage to clear the eggs and eventually defeat Vera.\nThe Jew Leaf Council is considered one of the more challenging bosses in the raid. To defeat this boss, cleanse your team regularly to remove the poison effects. The boss has a splitting mechanic, making it necessary to hit every copy until you find the real one. Bring units with area of effect attacks, sustain, and healing to effectively beat this boss.\nThe final boss, Queen Azmakalis, combines elements from other bosses in the raid. Accompanied by eggs and ads, she deals significant damage and applies debuffs. Bring units that provide healing, sustain, and cleanses to survive. In the nightmare mode, access to dispel abilities and artifacts becomes crucial. But for the beginner levels, focus on healing, clearing debuffs, and managing the ads to defeat Queen Azmakalis.\nLet’s now discuss the Labyrinth shop, which allows you to purchase various items with the resources earned from the raids. These items include malicious bug charms for entering the cycle of Azmakalis, Labyrinth compasses for raid entry, and accessory chests that contain level 22 to 60 gear (not recommended for purchase). However, one noteworthy item to acquire from the Labyrinth shop is charms for upgrading your accessories. Accessories play a significant role in the game, and obtaining charms makes upgrading them easier. Therefore, it’s advisable to stock up on these charms with the ancient coins earned in the raid.\nFinally, we want to touch on the Astmakalis cycle’s nightmare version. This is the end game content you should start preparing for, as it offers valuable rewards like 88 pieces of high-level gear. Although nightmare mode requires a different strategy, focusing on the one-clear version and the normal version of the cycle first is a good starting point.\nIn conclusion, the Royal Capital Azmakalis raid has undergone significant changes, making it essential to stay up-to-date with the latest strategies and compositions. By following our guide, you should have a clear understanding of the raid mechanics, boss encounters, party compositions, and the rewards available in the Labyrinth shop. Remember to continuously upgrade your gear and units to tackle the nightmare mode in the future. Good luck on your Epic Seven raiding journey!\n","wordCount":"963","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Angela Picou"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-loid.github.io/posts/epic-seven-raid-guide/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Loid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-loid.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Loid (Alt + H)"><img src=https://game-loid.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Loid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://game-loid.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://game-loid.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Labyrinth Raid Beginner Guide: A Comprehensive Epic Seven Raid Guide for Royal Capital Azmakalis + Cycle</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;963 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Angela Picou</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_QzPn6bK7g style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Welcome to our Epic Seven Labyrinth Raid Beginner Guide!
