Don’t worry, you’re not alone. While this faction may not have the easiest Champions to work with, there are some hidden gems that can make your journey through the faction wars much easier. In this article, we will explore the different bosses, discuss the strategies to defeat them, and analyze the available Champions in the faction. Plus, we’ll even attempt to beat the stage 21 boss without any legendaries or crazy gear. So grab your coffee and let’s dive into the world of Banner Lords!\nExploring the Bosses Before we delve into the strategies, let’s take a closer look at the different bosses you’ll encounter in the Banner Lords faction. While some stages may be relatively easy, others require some careful planning and strategy.\nStage 14: The Dueler The Dueler is one of the tougher bosses in this faction. He has the ability to stun one of your Champions with true fear and then hit them with a devastating Max HP hit immediately after. To conquer this boss, you’ll need to strategize and come prepared with the right team.\nStrategy: Dealing with the Max HP Hit The Max HP hit from the Dueler can be a challenge to overcome since it hits hard regardless of your Champions’ HP or defense stats. To counter this, there are two primary approaches you can take: ally protection and revival.\nAlly Protection: By bringing in Champions with ally protection abilities, you can mitigate the damage your team takes from the boss. This allows you to survive the Max HP hits and keep fighting. Revival: Having a reviver on your team can be a game-changer. Even if one of your Champions falls, a reviver can bring them back into the fight, ensuring your team’s survival. Additionally, using strength and buff abilities can reduce the incoming damage, lessening the impact of the Max HP hit. Don’t forget to include healing abilities in your team composition to quickly restore your Champions’ health after surviving the hits.\nStage 21: The Protector The Protector may not be the most difficult boss in the faction, but it still poses a challenge. With an ally attack ability and a revive skill, this boss can be a bit tricky to handle. However, he doesn’t place many debuffs on your team, making the fight more manageable.\nStrategy: Target the Boss, Ignore the Ads When facing the Protector, it is recommended to ignore the ads on the side and focus solely on the boss. While your Allies may automatically attack the ads during auto mode, manually targeting the boss will simplify the encounter.\nTo defeat the Protector, you must ensure your team can withstand the attacks from the minions on the side and survive the ally attack from the boss. Prioritize building a team with a strong healing and survivability aspect to easily overcome this challenge.\nThe Hidden Gems of Banner Lords Now that we’ve discussed the boss strategies, let’s turn our attention to the Champions available in the Banner Lords faction. While legendaries are undoubtedly powerful additions to any team, there are also some exceptional epics and rares worth considering.\nEssential Champions Archmage Helmut: A legendary Champion who brings great buffs, speed, and an AOE stun to the team. Archmage Helmut is a valuable asset in overcoming the faction wars. Stag Knight: This Champion is essential for his AOE decreased defense, decreased attack, and decreased speed abilities. The decrease defense skill allows your team to deal more damage, making Stag Knight a valuable addition. Ursala the Mourner: As the only epic reviver in the faction, Ursala brings invaluable support to the team. She also provides helpful buffs like strengthen and increased defense, along with an AOE decrease attack ability. Azure: While underrated, Azure is an exceptional ally protection Champion who can greatly enhance your team’s survivability. With his massive AOE ally protection ability, he is a valuable asset in the faction wars. Underrated Champions Valerie: This rare Champion is vastly underrated but possesses a sizable shield and a buff extension ability. Pairing Valerie with an ally protection Champion like Azure can provide excellent support and survivability. Meridian: Another rare Champion, Meridian offers AOE ally protection, continuous healing, and a provoke ability on his A1 skill. He is a solid choice for tanking and support in the faction wars. Steadfast Marshall: With his veil ability that redirects damage to him and an increased defense buff, Steadfast Marshall offers a unique playstyle. While not necessary, he can be a strong addition to your team. Remember that building a balanced team with proper healing, survivability, and damage-dealing capabilities is crucial for success in the faction wars. Utilize the strengths and abilities of these Champions to your advantage and customize your team based on the stage and boss you’re facing.\nConquering the Banner Lords Faction Now that we’ve covered the strategies and highlighted the essential and underrated Champions, it’s time to put our knowledge to the test. In our attempt to beat the stage 21 boss without legendaries or crazy gear, we’ll employ the following team composition:\nStag Knight: A crucial Champion with AOE decreased defense, decreased attack, and decreased speed abilities. Azure: An excellent ally protection Champion with a massive AOE ally protection ability, enhancing survivability. Ursala the Mourner: The only epic reviver in the faction wars, providing essential support and buffs. Dagger: A rare Champion with potentially useful utilities in this fight. Valerie: An underrated rare Champion with a sizable shield and buff extension ability. While this team may not be optimized, it does provide a solid foundation to tackle the faction wars. Don’t forget to adapt your team and strategy based on your available Champions and their unique abilities.\nIn Conclusion The Banner Lords faction may present its challenges, but with the right strategies and Champions, victory is within reach. By utilizing the hidden gems and optimizing your team composition, you can overcome the faction wars and claim victory for your faction. Remember to focus on ally protection, healing, and survival, and tailor your team to the specific boss and stage you’re facing.
